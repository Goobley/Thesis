``I'm not lost, because I haven't any idea where to go that I might get lost on the way to. I'd like to get lost, because then I'd know where I was going, you see.''
-- Catherynne M. Valente, The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making


``All you can do, Rosemary – all any of us can do – is work to be something positive instead. That is a choice that every sapient must make every day of their life. The universe is what we make of it. It’s up to you to decide what part you will play.''
-- Becky Chambers, The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet
