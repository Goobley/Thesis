The computational domain covers the photosphere, the chromosphere, the transition region, and the corona with the initial hydrostatic preflare atmosphere. To demonstrate the potential of the code, we calculate the time evolution of the Balmer line profiles corresponding to the time variation of the electron beam flux derived from the observed flare hard X-ray emission. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {Context.Inversion techniques are the most powerful methods to obtain information about the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of solar and stellar atmospheres. In the recent years, we have witnessed the development of highly sophisticated inversion codes that are now widely applied to spectro-polarimetric observations. The majority of these inversion codes are based on the optimization of a complicated non-linear merit function. The experience gained has facilitated the recovery of the model that best fits a given observation. However, and except for the recently developed inversion codes based on database search algorithms together with the application of Principal Component Analysis, no reliable and statistically well-defined confidence intervals can be obtained for the parameters inferred from the inversions.Aims.A correct estimation of the confidence intervals for all the parameters that describe the model is mandatory. Additionally, it is fundamental to apply efficient techniques to assess the ability of models to reproduce the observations and to determine to what extent the models have to be refined or can be simplified.Methods.Bayesian techniques are applied to analyze the performance of the model to fit a given observed Stokes vector. The posterior distribution, that takes into account both the information about the priors and the likelihood, is efficiently sampled using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For simplicity, we focus on the Milne-Eddington approximate solution of the radiative transfer equation and we only take into account the generation of polarization through the Zeeman effect. However, the method is extremely general and other more complex forward models can be applied, even allowing for the presence of atomic polarization.Results.We illustrate the method with different problems, from academic to more realistic examples. We show that the information provided by the posterior distribution is fundamental to understand and determine the amount of information available in the Stokes profiles in these particular cases. {\textcopyright} 2007 ESO.},

The H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ intensity excesses in three identified are footpoints are well correlated in time. We examine the ratio of H$\alpha$ to H$\beta$ are excess, which was proposed by previous authors as a possible diagnostic of the level of electron beam energy input. In the stronger footpoints, the typical value of the the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ intensity ratio observed is ∼ 0:4-0:5, in broad agreement with values obtained from a RADYN non-LTE simulation driven by an electron beam with parameters constrained (as far as possible) by observation. The weaker footpoint has a larger H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio, again consistent with a RADYN simulation but with a smaller energy ux. The H$\alpha$ line profiles observed have a less prominent central reversal than is predicted by the RADYN results, but can be brought into agreement if the H$\alpha$-emitting material has a filling factor of around 0.2-0.3.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Using RHESSI data, we have analyzed some 172 hard X-ray peaks during 53 solar flares which exhibited a double-footpoint structure. Fitting both footpoints with power-laws, we find that spectral index differences range mostly between 0 to 0.6, and only rarely go beyond. Asymmetries between footpoints were not observed to be significantly dependent on their mean heliographic position, their relative position with respect to each other, nor their orientation with respect to the solar equator. Assuming a symmetric acceleration process, it is also clear that differences in footpoint spectral indices and footpoint flux ratios can seldom be attributed to a difference in column densities between the two legs of a coronal loop. Our results corroborate better the magnetic mirror trap scenario. Moreover, footpoint asymmetries are more marked during times of peak HXR flux than when averaging over the whole HXR burst, suggesting that the magnetic configuration evolves during individual HXR bursts. We observed also a linear correlation between the peak 50-keV flux and the peak GOES 1-8A channel flux, and that HXR burst duration seem correlated with loop length.},

abstract = {Various solar features can be seen on maps of the Sun in the mm and sub-mm wavelength range. The recently installed Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is capable of observing the Sun in that wavelength range with an unprecedented spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. To interpret solar observations with ALMA the first important step is to compare ALMA maps with simultaneous images of the Sun recorded in other spectral ranges. First we identify different structures in the solar atmosphere seen in the optical, IR and EUV parts of the spectrum (quiet Sun (QS), active regions (AR), prominences on the disc, magnetic inversion lines (IL), coronal holes (CH) and coronal bright points (CBPs)) in a full disc solar ALMA image. The second aim is to measure the intensities (brightness temperatures) of those structures and compare them with the corresponding QS level. A full disc solar image at 1.21 mm obtained on December 18, 2015 during a CSV-EOC campaign with ALMA is calibrated and compared with full disc solar images from the same day in H\alpha, in He I 1083 nm core, and with SDO images (AIA at 170 nm, 30.4 nm, 21.1 nm, 19.3 nm, and 17.1 nm and HMI magnetogram). The brightness temperatures of various structures are determined by averaging over corresponding regions of interest in the ALMA image. Positions of the QS, ARs, prominences on the disc, ILs, CHs and CBPs are identified in the ALMA image. At 1.21 mm ARs appear as bright areas (but sunspots are dark), while prominences on the disc and CHs are not discernible from the QS background, although having slightly less intensity than surrounding QS regions. ILs appear as large, elongated dark structures and CBPs correspond to ALMA bright points. These results are in general agreement with sparse earlier measurements at similar wavelengths. The identification of CBPs represents the most important new result.},

In this paper, we focus on modeling the gyroresonance and free--free emission from an on-disk solar active region model with realistic complexities in electron density, temperature and magnetic field distribution. We compare the magnetic field parameters extrapolated from the image data cube along each line of sight after folding through the EOVSA instrumental profile with the original (unfolded) parameters used in the model. We find that even the most easily automated, image-based analysis approach (Level-0) provides reasonable quantitative results, although they are affected by systematic effects due to finite sampling in the Fourier (UV) plane. Finally, we note the potential for errors due to misidentified harmonics of the gyrofrequency, and discuss the prospects for applying a more sophisticated spectrally based analysis scheme (Level-1) to resolve the issue in cases where improved UV coverage and spatial resolution are available.},

abstract = {The observation of the high-temperature (10 MK) Fe XXI1354.1 {\AA} line with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph has provided significant insights into the chromospheric evaporation process in flares. In particular, the line is often observed to be completely blueshifted, in contrast to previous observations at lower spatial and spectral resolution, and in agreement with predictions from theoretical models. Interestingly, the line is also observed to be mostly symmetric and significantly broader than expected from thermal motions (assuming the peak formation temperature of the ion is in equilibrium). One popular interpretation for the nonthermal broadening is the superposition of flows from different loop strands.In this work, we test this scenario by forward-modeling the Fe XXIline profile assuming different possible observational scenarios using hydrodynamic simulations of multi-thread flare loops with the 1D RADYN code. Our results indicate that the superposition of flows alone cannot easily reproduce both the symmetry and the significant broadening of the line and that some other physical process, such as turbulence, or a much larger ion temperature than previously expected, likely needs to be invoked in order to explain the observed profiles.},

The properties and intrinsic errors of an "optimal" algorithm are discussed and a flux-corrected form of such an algorithm is demonstrated for a restricted class of problems. This optimal FCT algorithm is applied to a model test problem and the error is monitored for comparison with more generally applicable algorithms. Several improved FCT algorithms are developed and judged against both standard flux-uncorrected transport algorithms and the optimal algorithm. These improved FCT algorithms are found to be four to eight times more accurate than standard non-FCT algorithms, nearly twice as accurate as the original SHASTA FCT algorithm, and approach the accuracy of the optimal algorithm. ?? 1976.},

abstract = {Efficient non-LTE multilevel radiative transfer calculations are needed for a proper interpretation of astrophysical spectra. In particular, realistic simulations of time-dependent processes or multi-dimensional phenomena require that the iterative method used to solve such non-linear and non-local problem is as fast as possible. There are several multilevel codes based on efficient iterative schemes that provide a very high convergence rate, especially when combined with mathematical acceleration techniques. The Forth-and-Back Implicit Lambda Iteration (FBILI) developed by Atanackovi{\'{c}}-Vukmanovi{\'{c}} et al. [1] is a Gauss-Seidel-type iterative scheme that is characterized by a very high convergence rate without the need of complementing it with additional acceleration techniques. In this paper we make the implementation of the FBILI method to the multilevel atom line transfer in 1D more explicit. We also consider some of its variants and investigate their convergence properties by solving the benchmark problem of CaII line formation in the solar atmosphere. Finally, we compare our solutions with results obtained with the well known code MULTI.},

abstract = {Stokes inversion techniques are very powerful methods for obtaining information on the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of solar and stellar atmospheres. In recent years, very sophisticated inversion codes have been developed that are now routinely applied to spectro-polarimetric observations. Most of these inversion codes are designed for finding an optimum solution to the nonlinear inverse problem. However, to obtain the location of potentially multimodal cases (ambiguities), the degeneracies, and the uncertainties of each parameter inferred from the inversions, algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), require to evaluate the likelihood of the model thousand of times and are computationally costly. Variational methods are a quick alternative to Monte Carlo methods by approximating the posterior distribution by a parametrized distribution. In this study, we introduce a highly flexible variational inference method to perform fast Bayesian inference, known as normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are a set of invertible, differentiable, and parametric transformations that convert a simple distribution into an approximation of any other complex distribution. If the transformations are conditioned on observations, the normalizing flows can be trained to return Bayesian posterior probability estimates for any observation. We illustrate the ability of the method using a simple Milne-Eddington model and a complex non-LTE inversion. However, the method is extremely general and other more complex forward models can be applied. The training procedure need only be performed once for a given prior parameter space and the resulting network can then generate samples describing the posterior distribution several orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques.},

The burst was imaged in total intensity, as well as both right and left circular polarization, at 24 frequencies distributed logarithmically over the range 2.4-14.0 GHz with spatial resolution ranging from $\sim$ 5"-29". This powerful new technique for studying microwave bursts shows that (1) even a relatively weak burst with a simple temporal and spectral morphology in total power can have a complex spatial structure, comprising three distinct sources; (2) the burst structure changes with frequency so that images at widely spaced frequencies show a different number and/or location of sources, whereas images at closely spaced frequencies reveal the relationship between sources at different frequencies; and (3) the brightness temperature spectrum of each source is different, so that the composite total-power spectrum is not representative of the spectrum of any individual source.},

abstract = {The simulation of systems with dynamics on strongly varying time scales is quite challenging and demanding with regard to possible numerical methods. A rather naive approach is to use the smallest necessary time step to guarantee a stable integration of the fast frequencies. However, this typically leads to unacceptable computational loads. Alternatively, multirate methods integrate the slow part of the system with a relatively large step size while the fast part is integrated with a small time step. In this work, a multirate integrator for constrained dynamical systems is derived in closed form via a discrete variational principle on a time grid consisting of macro and micro time nodes. Being based on a discrete version of Hamilton's principle, the resulting variational multirate integrator is a symplectic and momentum preserving integration scheme and also exhibits good energy behaviour. Depending on the discrete approximations for the Lagrangian function, one obtains different integrators, e.g. purely implicit or purely explicit schemes, or methods that treat the fast and slow parts in different ways. The performance of the multirate integrator is demonstrated by means of several examples.},

abstract = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large eruptions of plasma and magnetic field from the low solar corona into interplanetary space. These eruptions are often associated with the acceleration of energetic electrons which produce various sources of high intensity plasma emission. In relatively rare cases, the energetic electrons may also produce gyrosynchrotron emission from within the CME itself, allowing for a diagnostic of the CME magnetic field strength. Such a magnetic field diagnostic is important for evaluating the total magnetic energy content of the CME, which is ultimately what drives the eruption. Here we report on an unusually large source of gyrosynchrotron radiation in the form of a type IV radio burst associated with a CME occurring on 2014-September-01, observed using instrumentation from the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Astronomy Facility. A combination of spectral flux density measurements from the Nan\c{c}ay instruments and the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN) from 300MHz to 5 GHz reveals a gyrosynchrotron spectrum with a peak flux density at $>$1 GHz. Using this radio analysis, a model for gyrosynchrotron radiation, a non-thermal electron density diagnostic using the Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and images of the eruption from the GOES Soft X-ray Imager (SXI), we are able to calculate both the magnetic field strength and the properties of the X-ray and radio emitting energetic electrons within the CME. We find the radio emission is produced by non-thermal electrons of energies >1MeV with a spectral index of $\delta$$\sim$3 in a CME magnetic field of 4.4 G at a height of 1.3 R$_{\odot}$, while the X-ray emission is produced from a similar distribution of electrons but with much lower energies on the order of 10 keV. We conclude by comparing X-ray and radio-emitting electron distributions and how such an analysis can be used to define the plasma properties of a CME.},

abstract = {A sample of Nobeyama flares was selected and analyzed using loop model for important flare parameters. The model for the flaring region consists of a three dimensional dipolar magnetic field, and spatial distributions of non-thermal electrons. We constructed a database by calculating the flare microwave emission for a wide range of these parameters. Out of this database with more than 5,000 cases we extracted general flare properties by comparing the observed and calculated microwave spectra. The analysis of NoRP data was mostly based in the center-to-limb variation of the flare properties with looptop and footpoint electron distributions and for NoRH maps on the resultant distribution of emission. One important aspect of this work is the comparison of the analysis of a flare using an inhomogeneous source model and a simplistic homogeneous source model. Our results show clearly that the homogeneous source hypothesis is not appropriate to describe the possible flare geometry and its use can easily produce misleading results in terms of non-thermal electron density and magnetic field strength. A center darkening of flares was also obtained as a geometrical property of the loop-like sources.},

abstract = {X-ray observations are a powerful diagnostic tool for transport, acceleration, and heating of electrons in solar flares. Height and size measurements of X-ray footpoint sources can be used to determine the chromospheric density and constrain the parameters of magnetic field convergence and electron pitch-angle evolution. We investigate the influence of the chromospheric density, magnetic mirroring, and collisional pitch-angle scattering on the size of X-ray sources. The time-independent Fokker-Planck equation for electron transport is solved numerically and analytically to find the electron distribution as a function of height above the photosphere. From this distribution, the expected X-ray flux as a function of height, its peak height, and full width at half-maximum are calculated and compared with RHESSI observations. A purely instrumental explanation for the observed source size was ruled out by using simulated RHESSI images. We find that magnetic mirroring and collisional pitch-angle scattering tend to change the electron flux such that electrons are stopped higher in the atmosphere compared with the simple case with collisional energy loss only. However, the resulting X-ray flux is dominated by the density structure in the chromosphere and only marginal increases in source width are found. Very high loop densities (>1011 cm–3) could explain the observed sizes at higher energies, but are unrealistic and would result in no footpoint emission below about 40 keV, contrary to observations. We conclude that within a monolithic density model the vertical sizes are given mostly by the density scale height and are predicted smaller than the RHESSI results show.},

In this paper these properties are related to concepts of connectivity from the theory of continuous-time Markov chains. For the irreducible case (in which every state is con- nected to every other state, either directly or through intermediate states), the solution is shown to be positive and unique when one positive normalization condition is provided. It is then shown how a general linear statistical equilibrium problem can be reduced by dividing the system into inessential and essential states and then partitioning the latter into separate irreducible subproblems. It is shown that: (1) The inessential states all have zero populations. If a positive normalization condition is imposed separately on each irreducible subproblem, then (2) the essential states all have positive populations and (3) the overall solution is unique.

abstract = {State-of-the-art approaches for semantic image segmentation are built on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The typical segmentation architecture is composed of (a) a downsampling path responsible for extracting coarse semantic features, followed by (b) an upsampling path trained to recover the input image resolution at the output of the model and, optionally, (c) a post-processing module (e.g. Conditional Random Fields) to refine the model predictions. Recently, a new CNN architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), has shown excellent results on image classification tasks. The idea of DenseNets is based on the observation that if each layer is directly connected to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion then the network will be more accurate and easier to train. In this paper, we extend DenseNets to deal with the problem of semantic segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results on urban scene benchmark datasets such as CamVid and Gatech, without any further post-processing module nor pretraining. Moreover, due to smart construction of the model, our approach has much less parameters than currently published best entries for these datasets.

Many slope limiters in standard use do not preserve linear solutions on irregular grids impacting both accuracy and convergence. We rewrite some well-known limiters to highlight their underlying symmetry, and use this form to examine the properties of both traditional and novel limiter formulations on non-uniform meshes. A consistent method of handling stretched meshes is developed which is both linearity preserving for arbitrary mesh stretchings and reduces to common limiters on uniform meshes. In multiple dimensions we analyze the rnonotonicity region of the gradient vector and show that the multidimensional limiting problem may be cast as the solution of a linear programming problem. For some special cases we present a new directional limiting formulation that preserves linear solutions in multiple dimensions on irregular grids. Computational results using model problems and complex three-dimensional examples are presented, demonstrating accuracy, monotonicity and robustness.

abstract = {The Atacama Large Millimeter-submillimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope has commenced science observations of the Sun starting in late 2016. Since the Sun is much larger than the field of view of individual ALMA dishes, the ALMA interferometer is unable to measure the background level of solar emission when observing the solar disk. The absolute temperature scale is a critical measurement for much of ALMA solar science, including the understanding of energy transfer through the solar atmosphere, the properties of prominences, and the study of shock heating in the chromosphere. In order to provide an absolute temperature scale, ALMA solar observing will take advantage of the remarkable fast-scanning capabilities of the ALMA 12m dishes to make single-dish maps of the full Sun. This article reports on the results of an extensive commissioning effort to optimize the mapping procedure, and it describes the nature of the resulting data. Amplitude calibration is discussed in detail: a path that utilizes the two loads in the ALMA calibration system as well as sky measurements is described and applied to commissioning data. Inspection of a large number of single-dish datasets shows significant variation in the resulting temperatures, and based on the temperature distributions we derive quiet-Sun values at disk center of 7300 K at lambda=3 mm and 5900 K at lambda=1.3 mm. These values have statistical uncertainties of order 100 K, but systematic uncertainties in the temperature scale that may be significantly larger. Example images are presented from two periods with very different levels of solar activity. At a resolution of order 25 arcsec, the 1.3 mm wavelength images show temperatures on the disk that vary over about a 2000 K range.},

@article{Milligan2011,
abstract = {This paper presents a detailed study of excess line broadening in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission lines during the impulsive phase of a C-class solar flare. In this work, which utilizes data from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on board Hinode, the broadened line profiles were observed to be cospatial with the two hard X-ray footpoints as observed by RHESSI. By plotting the derived nonthermal velocity for each pixel within the Fe XV and Fe XVI rasters against its corresponding Doppler velocity a strong correlation (|r| > 0.59) was found between the two parameters for one of the footpoints. This suggested that the excess broadening at these temperatures is due to a superposition of flows (turbulence), presumably as a result of chromospheric evaporation due to nonthermal electrons. Also presented are diagnostics of electron densities using five pairs of density-sensitive line ratios. Density maps derived using the Mg VII and Si X line pairs showed no appreciable increase in electron density at the footpoints, whereas the Fe XII, Fe XIII, and Fe XIV line pairs revealed densities approaching 1011.5 cm-3. Using this information, the nonthermal velocities derived from the widths of the two Fe XIV lines were plotted against their corresponding density values derived from their ratio. This showed that pixels with large nonthermal velocities were associated with pixels of moderately higher densities. This suggests that nonthermal broadening at these temperatures may have been due to enhanced densities at the footpoints, although estimates of the amount of opacity broadening and pressure broadening appeared to be negligible.},

@article{Kerr2019a,
abstract = {To extract the information that the Mg II NUV spectra (observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph; IRIS), carries about the chromosphere during solar flares, and to validate models of energy transport via model-data comparison, forward modelling is required. The assumption of statistical equilibrium is typically used to obtain the atomic level populations from snapshots of flare atmospheres, due to computational necessity. However it is possible that relying on statistical equilibrium could lead to spurious results. We compare solving the atomic level populations via statistical equilibrium versus a non-equilibrium time-dependent approach. This was achieved using flare simulations from RADYN alongside the minority species version, MS_RADYN, from which the time-dependent Mg II atomic level populations and radiation transfer were computed in complete frequency redistribution. The impacts on the emergent profiles, lightcurves, line ratios, and formation heights are discussed. In summary we note that non-equilibrium effects during flares are typically important only in the initial stages and for a short period following the cessation of the energy injection. An analysis of the timescales of ionisation equilibrium reveals that for most of the duration of the flare, when the temperatures and densities are sufficiently enhanced, the relaxation timescales are short ($\tau_{\mathrm{relax}}<0.1$ s), so that the equilibrium solution is an adequate approximation. These effects vary with the size of the flare, however. In weaker flares effects can be more pronounced. We recommend that non-equilibrium effects be considered when possible, but that statistical equilibrium is sufficient at most stages of the flare.},

abstract = {The solar submillimeter-wave telescope (SST) is the only one of its kind dedicated to solar continuous observations. Two radiometers at 0.740 mm (405 GHz), and four at 1.415 mm (212 GHz) are placed in the Cassegrain focal plane of the 1.5-m dish at El Leoncito high altitude site, San Juan, Argentina. The aperture efficiencies are close to design predictions: 20% and 35% for 2 and 4 arcminutes beam sizes at 405 and 212 GHz, respectively. The positioner absolute pointing accuracy is 10 arcseconds. Spectral coverage is complemented by ground-based mid-infrared telescopes developed for high cadence observations in the continuum 10 micron band (30 THz), using small apertures and roomtemperature microbolometer cameras. Using the system, a new solar burst spectral component was discovered, exhibiting fluxes increasing for smaller wavelengths, separated from the well known microwave component. Rapid subsecond pulsations are common for all bursts. The pulsations onset times of appear to be connected to the launch times of CMEs. Active regions are brighter for shorter submillimeter-waves. Mid-IR bright regions are found closely associated with calcium plages and magnetic structures near the solar photosphere. Intense and rapid 10 micron brightening was detected on active centers in association with weak flares. These results raise challenging difficulties for interpretation.},

abstract = {The study presented here has two goals. The first is to examine the role of energy transport mechanisms in flare dynamics, for instance, thermal cone conduction in the corona and radiative transfer in the chromosphere. The second is to provide diagnostics of flare energization processes by predicting the evolutionary behavior of concurrent emissions from all regions of the flaring atmosphere. To attain these ends, a numerical method is developed for the simultaneous solution of thy continuity, momentum, and energy equations; the time-dependent atomic rate equations describing ionization and excitation; and the radiative transfer equations. With the physical model and computational methods used here, all components of the plasma move as a single fluid and in the initial studies are assumed to have a common kinetic temperature. The plasma is constrained to move in one dimension along the axis of a loop of nonuniform cross section, the geometry of which is defined by a sufficiently strong magnetic field.},

@article{Sui2007,
abstract = {The determination of the low-energy cutoff to nonthermal electron distributions is critical to the calculation of the nonthermal energy in solar flares. The most direct evidence for low-energy cutoffs is flattening of the power-law, nonthermal X-ray spectra at low energies. However, because of the plasma preheating often seen in flares, the thermal emissions at low energies may hide such spectral flattening of the nonthermal component. We select a category of flares, which we call "early impulsive flares," in which the > 25 keV hard X-ray (HXR) flux increase is delayed by less than 30 s after the flux increase at lower energies. Thus, the plasma preheating in these flares is minimal, so the nonthermal spectrum can be determined to lower energies than in flares with significant preheating. Out of a sample of 33 early impulsive flares observed by the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopy Imager (RHESSI), nine showed spectral flattening toward low energies. In these events, the break energy of the double power-law fit to the HXR spectra lies in the range 10-50 keV, significantly lower than the value we have seen for other flares that do not show such early impulsive emissions. In particular, it correlates with the HXR flux, After correcting the spatially integrated spectra for albedo from isotropically emitted X-rays and using RHESSI imaging spectroscopy to exclude the extended albedo halo, we find that albedo associated with isotropic or nearly isotropic electrons can only account for the spectral flattening in three flares near Sun center. The spectral flattening in the remaining six flares is found to be consistent with the existence of a low-energy cutoff in the electron spectrum, falling in the range 15-50 keV, which also correlates with the HXR flux. {\textcopyright} 2007.

abstract = {Context. The ionization of hydrogen in the solar chromosphere and transition region does not obey LTE or instantaneous statistical equilibrium because the timescale is long compared with important hydrodynamical timescales, especially of magneto-acoustic shocks. Since the pressure, temperature, and electron density depend sensitively on hydrogen ionization, numerical simulation of the solar atmosphere requires non-equilibrium treatment of all pertinent hydrogen transitions. The same holds for any diagnostic application employing hydrogen lines. Aims. To demonstrate the importance and to quantify the effects of non-equilibrium hydrogen ionization, both on the dynamical structure of the solar atmosphere and on hydrogen line formation, in particular H$\alpha$. Methods. We implement an algorithm to compute non-equilibrium hydrogen ionization and its coupling into the MHD equations within an existing radiation MHD code, and perform a two-dimensional simulation of the solar atmosphere from the convection zone to the corona. Results. Analysis of the simulation results and comparison to a companion simulation assuming LTE shows that: a) non-equilibrium computation delivers much smaller variations of the chromospheric hydrogen ionization than for LTE. The ionization is smaller within shocks but subsequently remains high in the cool intershock phases. As a result, the chromospheric temperature variations are much larger than for LTE because in non-equilibrium, hydrogen ionization is a less effective internal energy buffer. The actual shock temperatures are therefore higher and the intershock temperatures lower. b) The chromospheric populations of the hydrogen n = 2 level, which governs the opacity of H$\alpha$, are coupled to the ion populations. They are set by the high temperature in shocks and subsequently remain high in the cool intershock phases. c) The temperature structure and the hydrogen level populations differ much between the chromosphere above photospheric magnetic elements and above quiet internetwork. d) The hydrogen n = 2 population and column density are persistently high in dynamic fibrils, suggesting that these obtain their visibility from being optically thick in H $\alpha$ also at low temperature. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

abstract = {We report the first science results from the newly completed Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA), which obtained excellent microwave imaging spectroscopy observations of SOL2017-09-10, a classic partially-occulted solar limb flare associated with an erupting flux rope. This event is also well-covered by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) in hard X-rays (HXRs). We present an overview of this event focusing on microwave and HXR data, both associated with high-energy nonthermal electrons, and discuss them within the context of the flare geometry and evolution revealed by extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/AIA). The EOVSA and RHESSI data reveal the evolving spatial and energy distribution of high-energy electrons throughout the entire flaring region. The results suggest that the microwave and HXR sources largely arise from a common nonthermal electron population, although the microwave imaging spectroscopy provides information over a much larger volume of the corona.},

A method is developed here to evaluate the electron scattering emissivity from a given radiation field which is considerably faster than previous methods based on straightforward evaluation of the scattering integral. This procedure is implemented in our multilevel radiative code (MALI), which now takes full account of the effects of noncoherent electron scattering on level populations, as well as on the emergent spectrum. Calculations using model atmospheres of hot, low-gravity stars display not only the expected broad wings of strong emission lines but also effects arising from the scattering of photons across continuum edges. In extreme cases this leads to significant shifts of the ionization equilibrium of helium.},

abstract = {A multilevel accelerated lambda iteration (MALI) method for radiative transfer calculations with partial frequency redistribution (PRD) is presented. The method, which is based on Rybicki & Hummer's complete frequency redistribution (CRD) formalism with full preconditioning, consistently accounts for overlapping radiative transitions. Its extension to PRD is implemented in a very natural way through the use of the $\Psi$ operator operating on the emissivity rather than the commonly used $\Lambda$ operator, which operates on the source function. Apart from requiring an additional inner computational loop to evaluate the PRD emission-line profiles with fixed population numbers, implementation of the presented method requires only a trivial addition of computer code. Since the presented method employs a diagonal operator, it is easily extended to different geometries. Currently, it has been implemented for one-, two-, and three-dimensional Cartesian grids and spherical symmetry. In all cases, the speed of convergence with PRD is very similar to that in CRD, with the former sometimes even surpassing the latter. Sample calculations exhibiting the favorable convergence behavior of the PRD code are presented in the case of the Ca II H and K lines, the Mg II h and k lines, and the hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ lines in a one-dimensional solar model and the Ca II resonance lines in a two-dimensional flux-sheet model.},

abstract = {Issue Title: Radio Physics and the Flare-CME Relationship / Guest Editors: Karl-Ludwig Klein and Silja Pohjolainen This study has been motivated by the detection of a small number of optically thin microwave bursts with maximum emission near the loop top, which is contrary to the prediction of isotropic gyrosynchrotron models. Using Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) high-spatial-resolution images at 17 and 34 GHz, we study the morphology at the radio peak of 104 flares that occurred relatively close to the limb. Using data from the Nobeyama Polarimeter we were able to determine whether the 17- and 34-GHz emissions came from optically thin or thick sources. We identified single-loop events, taking into account supplementary information from EUV and soft X-ray (SXR) images. We found optically thin emission from the top of the loop in 36% of single-loop events. In agreement with standard models, in this sample 46% and 18% of the events showed optically thin emission from the footpoints and optically thick emission from the entire loop, respectively. The derived percentage of events with gyrosynchrotron emission from isotropic populations of energetic electrons is possibly an upper limit. This point is illustrated by the analysis of an optically thin event that shows footpoint emission during the rise phase and loop-top emission during the decay phase. A model that takes into account both anisotropies in the distribution function of nonthermal electrons and time evolution can reproduce the observed transition from footpoint to loop-top morphology, if electrons with pitch-angle anisotropy are injected near one of the footpoints.

This flare is one of the few in which emission up to energies exceeding 200 keV can be imaged in hard X-rays. Furthermore, we can investigate the spectra of individual sources up to this energy. We discuss and compare the HXR and microwave spectra and morphology. Although the event overall appears to correspond to the standard scenario with magnetic reconnection under an eruptive filament, several of its features do not seem to be consistent with popular flare models. In particular we find that (1) microwave emissions might be optically thick at high frequencies despite a low peak frequency in the total flux radio spectrum, presumably due to the inhomogeneity of the emitting source; (2) magnetic fields in high-frequency radio sources might be stronger than sometimes assumed; (3) sources spread over a very large volume can show matching evolution in their hard X-ray spectra that may provide a challenge to acceleration models. Our results emphasize the importance of studies of sunspot-associated flares and total flux measurements of radio bursts in the millimeter range.},

abstract = {We report on radiative hydrodynamic simulations of moderate and strong solar flares. The flares were simulated by calculating the atmospheric response to a beam of nonthermal electrons injected at the apex of a one-dimensional closed coronal loop and include heating from thermal soft X-ray, extreme ultraviolet, and ultraviolet (XEUV) emission. The equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium were treated in non-LTE and solved for numerous transitions of hydrogen, helium, and Ca II, allowing the calculation of detailed line profiles and continuum emission. This work improves on previous simulations by incorporating more realistic nonthermal electron beam models and includes a more rigorous model of thermal XEUV heating. We find that XEUV back-warming contributes less than 10% of the heating, even in strong flares. The simulations show elevated coronal and transition region densities resulting in dramatic increases in line and continuum emission in both the UV and optical regions. The optical continuum reaches a peak increase of several percent, which is consistent with enhancements observed in solar white-light flares. For a moderate flare ($\sim$M class), the dynamics are characterized by a long gentle phase of near balance between flare heating and radiative cooling, followed by an explosive phase with beam heating dominating over cooling and characterized by strong hydrodynamic waves. For a strong flare ($\sim$X class), the gentle phase is much shorter, and we speculate that for even stronger flares the gentle phase may be essentially nonexistent. During the explosive phase, synthetic profiles for lines formed in the upper chromosphere and transition region show blueshifts corresponding to a plasma velocity of $\sim$120 km s-1, and lines formed in the lower chromosphere show redshifts of $\sim$40 km s-1.},

abstract = {Observational and theoretical evidence suggests that coronal heating is impulsive and occurs on very small cross-field spatial scales. A single coronal loop could contain a hundred or more individual strands that are heated quasi-independently by nanoflares. It is therefore an enormous undertaking to model an entire active region or the global corona. Three-dimensional MHD codes have inadequate spatial resolution, and one-dimensional (1D) hydrodynamic codes are too slow to simulate the many thousands of elemental strands that must be treated in a reasonable representation. Fortunately, thermal conduction and flows tend to smooth out plasma gradients along the magnetic field, so zero-dimensional (0D) models are an acceptable alternative. We have developed a highly efficient model called ``enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops'' (EBTEL), which accurately describes the evolution of the average temperature, pressure, and density along a coronal strand. It improves significantly on earlier models of this type-in accuracy, flexibility, and capability. It treats both slowly varying and highly impulsive coronal heating; it provides the time-dependent differential emission measure distribution, DEM(T), at the transition region footpoints; and there are options for heat flux saturation and nonthermal electron beam heating. EBTEL gives excellent agreement with far more sophisticated 1D hydrodynamic simulations despite using 4 orders of magnitude less computing time. It promises to be a powerful new tool for solar and stellar studies.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a one-dimensional adaptive moving mesh method and its application to hyperbolic conservation laws from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The method is robust, because it employs automatic control of mesh adaptation when a new model is considered, without manually-set parameters. Adaptive meshes are a common tool for increasing the accuracy and reducing computational costs when solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Mesh points are moved towards locations where they are needed the most. To obtain a time-dependent adaptive mesh, monitor functions are used to automatically ‘monitor' the importance of the various parts of the domain, by assigning a ‘weight'-value to each location. Based on the equidistribution principle, all mesh points are distributed according to their assigned weights. We use a sophisticated monitor function that tracks both small, local phenomena as well as large shocks in the same solution. The combination of the moving mesh method and a high-resolution finite volume solver for hyperbolic PDEs yields a serious gain in accuracy at relatively no extra costs. The results of several numerical experiments including comparisons with h-refinement are presented, which cover many intriguing aspects typifying nonlinear magnetofluid dynamics, with higher accuracy than often seen in similar publications.},

@article{Lambert2015,
abstract = {Context. The solution of the nonlocal thermodynamical equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer equation usually relies on stationary iterative methods, which may falsely converge in some cases. Furthermore, these methods are often unable to handle large-scale systems, such as molecular spectra emerging from, for example, cool stellar atmospheres. Aims. Our objective is to develop a new method, which aims to circumvent these problems, using nonstationary numerical techniques and taking advantage of parallel computers. Methods. The technique we develop may be seen as a generalization of the coupled escape probability method. It solves the statistical equilibrium equations in all layers of a discretized model simultaneously. The numerical scheme adopted is based on the generalized minimum residual method. Results. The code has already been applied to the special case of the water spectrum in a red supergiant stellar atmosphere. This demonstrates the fast convergence of this method, and opens the way to a wide variety of astrophysical problems.},

@article{Carlsson1997,
abstract = {We have simulated the generation of Ca II H2V bright grains by acoustic shocks. We employ a one-dimensional, non-LTE radiation-hydrodynamic code, with six-level model atoms for hydrogen and singly ionized calcium. We drive acoustic waves through a stratified radiative equilibrium atmosphere by a piston, whose velocity is chosen to match the Doppler shift observed in the Fe I 396.68 nm line in the H line wing, formed at about 260 km above tau 500 = 1. The simulations closely match the observed behavior of Ca II H2V bright grains down to the level of individual grains. The bright grains are produced by shocks near 1 Mm above tau 500 = 1. Shocks in the mid-chromosphere produce a large source function (and therefore high emissivity) because the density is high enough for collisions to couple the Ca II populations to the local conditions. The asymmetry of the line profile is due to velocity gradients near 1 Mm. Material motion Doppler-shifts the frequency at which atoms emit and absorb photons, so the maximum opacity is located at---and the absorption profile is symmetric about---the local fluid velocity, which is shifted to the blue behind shocks. The optical depth depends upon the velocity structure higher up. Shocks propagate generally into downflowing material, so there is little matter above to absorb the Doppler-shifted radiation. The corresponding red peak is absent because of small opacity at the source function maximum and large optical depth due to overlying material. The bright grains are produced primarily by waves from the photosphere that are slightly above the acoustic cutoff frequency. The precise time and strength of a grain depend upon the interference between these waves near the acoustic cutoff frequency and higher frequency waves. When waves near the acoustic cutoff frequency are weak, then higher frequency waves may produce grains. The "5 minute" trapped p-mode oscillations are not the source of the grains, although they can slightly modify the behavior of higher frequency waves.},

abstract = {Context. The radiative energy balance in the solar chromosphere is dominated by strong spectral lines that are formed out of LTE. It is computationally prohibitive to solve the full equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium in 3D time dependent MHD simulations. Aims: We look for simple recipes to compute the radiative energy balance in the dominant lines under solar chromospheric conditions. Methods: We use detailed calculations in time-dependent and 2D MHD snapshots to derive empirical formulae for the radiative cooling and heating. Results: The radiative cooling in neutral hydrogen lines and the Lyman continuum, the H and K and intrared triplet lines of singly ionized calcium and the h and k lines of singly ionized magnesium can be written as a product of an optically thin emission (dependent on temperature), an escape probability (dependent on column mass) and an ionization fraction (dependent on temperature). In the cool pockets of the chromosphere the same transitions contribute to the heating of the gas and similar formulae can be derived for these processes. We finally derive a simple recipe for the radiative heating of the chromosphere from incoming coronal radiation. We compare our recipes with the detailed results and comment on the accuracy and applicability of the recipes.},

@article{MorenoCardenas2016,
abstract = {On Thursday, September 1, 1859, the British astronomer Richard Carrington, for the first time ever, observes a spectacular gleam of visible light on the surface of the solar disk, the photosphere. The Carrington Event, as it is nowadays known by scientists, occurred because of the high solar activity that had visible consequences on Earth, in particular reports of outstanding aurorae activity that amazed thousands of people in the western hemisphere during the dawn of September 2. The geomagnetic storm, generated by the solar-terrestrial event, had such a magnitude that the auroral oval expanded towards the equator, allowing low latitudes, like Panama's 9°N, to catch a sight of the aurorae. An expedition was carried out to review several historical reports and books from the northern cities of Colombia allowed the identification of a narrative from Monter{\'{i}}a, Colombia (8° 45′N), that describes phenomena resembling those of an aurorae borealis, such as fire-like lights, blazing and dazzling glares, and the appearance of an immense S-like shape in the sky. The very low latitude of the geomagnetic north pole in 1859, the lowest value in over half a millennia, is proposed to have allowed the observations of auroral events at locations closer to the equator, and supports the historical description found in Colombia. The finding of such chronicle represents one of the most complete descriptions of low-latitude sightings of aurorae caused by the Carrington Event.},

abstract = {An analytical model for the quiescent inhomogeneous solar corona is developed on the basis of the hypothesis that looplike structures are the basic coronal building blocks. By assuming that quiescent loop structures observed in X-rays are in hydrostatic equilibrium, it is demonstrated that such loops must have their temperature maximum located near their apex and that substantial nonradiative energy deposition must occur along most of their length. The calculations yield a unique relation among loop temperature, pressure, and size, which fits the X-ray observations of quiescent structures well and is consistent with the initial assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. The results suggest that the coronal loops visible in X-rays represent a relatively steady-state equilibrium of the confined plasmas and that fluctuations in such quantities as the local heating rate can lead to dynamically unstable states in which the loop plasma does not attain a temperature sufficient for X-ray emission. A parameterization of various proposed coronal heating theories is also developed within the context of the analytical model.},

abstract = {We present new analyses of ALMA 12-m and ACA observations at 233 GHz (1.3 mm) of the Proxima Centauri system with sensitivities of 9.5 and 47 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively, taken from 2017 January 21 through 2017 April 25. These analyses reveal that the star underwent a significant flaring event during one of the ACA observations on 2017 March 24. The complete event lasted for approximately 1 minute and reached a peak flux density of $100\pm4$ mJy, nearly a factor of $1000\times$ brighter than the star's quiescent emission. At the flare peak, the continuum emission is characterized by a steeply falling spectral index with frequency, $F_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$ with $\alpha = -1.77\pm0.45$, and a lower limit on the fractional linear polarization of $|Q/I| = 0.19\pm0.02$. Since the ACA observations do not show any quiescent excess emission, we conclude that there is no need to invoke the presence of a dust belt at $1-4$ AU. We also posit that the slight excess flux density of $101\pm9$ $\mu$Jy observed in the 12-m observations compared to the photospheric flux density of $74\pm4$ $\mu$Jy extrapolated from infrared wavelengths may be due to coronal heating from continual smaller flares, as is seen for AU Mic, another nearby, well-studied, M dwarf flare star. If this is true, then the need for warm dust at $\sim0.4$ AU is also removed.},

This technique relies on the reformulation of the fifth-order WENO-JS (WENO scheme presented by Jiang and Shu in J. Comput. Phys. 126:202–228, 1995) scheme designed on uniform grids in terms of one cell-averaged value and its left and/or right interfacial values of the dependent variable. The effect of grid non-uniformity is taken into consideration by a proper interpolation of the interfacial values. On non-uniform grids, the proposed scheme is much more accurate than the original WENO-JS scheme, which was designed for uniform grids. When the grid is uniform, the resulting scheme reduces to the original WENO-JS scheme. In the meantime, the proposed scheme is computationally much more efficient than the fifth-order WENO scheme designed specifically for the non-uniform grids. A number of numerical test cases are simulated to verify the performance of the present scheme.},

Multiple implementations of MPI have been developed. In this paper, we describe MPICH, unique among existing implementations in its design goal of combining portability with high performance. We document its portability and performance and describe the architecture by which these features are simultaneously achieved.

A project of this scope inevitably imparts lessons about parallel computing, the specification being followed, the current hardware and software environment for parallel computing, and project management; we describe those we have learned.

abstract = {Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian SPH technique, or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with adaptive mesh refinement. Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean-invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new parallel code AREPO, both in 2D and 3D. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that it provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques. (abridged)},

abstract = {Context. Observations of the solar atmosphere of ever increasing spatial resolution reveal steep gradients in the magnetic field and in thermal states. Likewise, numerical simulations of the solar atmosphere show contact discontinuities and shock fronts. This asks for the development of robust methods for computing the radiative transfer of polarized light in discontinuous media. Aims. Here, we propose a new concept for dealing with discontinuities in the radiative transfer of polarized light and carry out a few basic test calculations. While in the past, the focus was on interpolating the source function with ever-increasing accuracy and smoothness, we propose to take the opposite approach by reconstructing it with piecewise continuous functions, taking discontinuities on purpose into account. This concept is known from computational fluid dynamics. Methods. Test calculations were carried out for (i) a Milne-Eddington atmosphere; (ii) an atmosphere featuring a single discontinuity that is shifted across one grid cell; and (iii) a two-layered atmosphere with discontinuities in the source function, the velocity, and the magnetic field. Results. It is shown that the method of piecewise continuous reconstruction is a viable approach to solving the radiative transfer equation for polarized light. In the special case where a discontinuity coincides with a computational cell interface, the method is capable of producing the exact solution. Overall, the assessment of the piecewise continuous reconstruction method turns out to be cautiously positive, but it does not lead to an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy over conventional methods for the examples considered here. More realistic model atmospheres need to be considered for judging practical applicability.},

abstract = {We investigate the influence of partial frequency redistribution (PRD) on radiative cooling due to the Ca II K line in a hydrostatic model of the quiet Sun, and in a series of 20 snapshots from a chromospheric radiation-hydrodynamics simulation. The net radiative rates in the K line were calculated through these models with three different frequency-redistribution formalisms: complete redistribution (CRD), angle-averaged PRD, and angle-dependent PRD. It is found that the approximation of CRD generally leads to an overestimate of the net radiative rates because of its neglect of coherent scattering. Compared to the more realistic full angle-dependent solution, angle-averaged PRD provides accurate emergent profiles and cooling rates in the hydrostatic model and also provides accurate instantaneous profiles in the dynamical snapshots, even when considerable macroscopic velocities are present. Instantaneous angle-averaged cooling rates in the dynamical snapshots may be different at times, but on average, cooling is very similar to the angle-dependent case. In the temperature minimum, the Ca II K line provides, on average, more cooling in the dynamic chromosphere at the same column mass than in the hydrostatic model. It provides less cooling in the chromosphere. Finally, we formulate an approximation for angle-averaged redistribution in a moving atmosphere, employing the unshifted redistribution function. This approximation is easy to implement in existing numerical codes and should provide an efficient method for PRD transfer solutions in dynamic models without loss of accuracy in emergent profiles and radiative cooling rates.},

@article{Simoes2013,
abstract = {The interrelation of hard X-ray (HXR) emitting sources and the underlying physics of electron acceleration and transport presents one of the major questions in high-energy solar flare physics. Spatially resolved observations of solar flares often demonstrate the presence of well-separated sources of bremsstrahlung emission, so-called coronal and footpoint sources. Using spatially resolved X-ray observations by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) and recently improved imaging techniques, we investigate in detail the spatially resolved electron distributions in a few well-observed solar flares. The selected flares can be interpreted as having a standard geometry with chromospheric HXR footpoint sources related to thick-target X-ray emission and the coronal sources characterised by a combination of thermal and thin-target bremsstrahlung. Using imaging spectroscopy techniques, we deduce the characteristic electron rates and spectral indices required to explain the coronal and footpoint X-ray sources. We found that, during the impulsive phase, the electron rate at the looptop is several times (a factor of 1.7-8) higher than at the footpoints. The results suggest that a sufficient number of electrons accelerated in the looptop explain the precipitation into the footpoints and imply that electrons accumulate in the looptop. We discuss these results in terms of magnetic trapping, pitch-angle scattering, and injection properties. Our conclusion is that the accelerated electrons must be subject to magnetic trapping and/or pitch-angle scattering, keeping a fraction of the population trapped inside the coronal loops. These findings put strong constraints on the particle transport in the coronal source and provide quantitative limits on deka-keV electron trapping/scattering in the coronal source.},

abstract = {Aims. The hydrogen Lyman lines provide important diagnostic information about the dynamics of the chromosphere, but there have been few systematic studies of their variability during flares. We investigate Doppler shifts in these lines in several flares, and use these to calculate plasma speeds. Methods. We use spectral data from the Multiple EUV Grating Spectrograph B (MEGS-B) detector of the Extreme-Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE) instrument on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. MEGS-B obtains full-disk spectra of the Sun at a resolution of 0.1 nm in the range 37-105 nm, which we analyse using three independent methods. The first method performs Gaussian fits to the lines, and compares the quiet-Sun centroids with the flaring ones to obtain the Doppler shifts. The second method uses cross-correlation to detect wavelength shifts between the quiet-Sun and flaring line profiles. The final method calculates the "center-of-mass" of the line profile, and compares the quiet-Sun and flaring centroids to obtain the shift. Results. In a study of 6 flares we find strong signatures of both upflow and downflow in the Lyman lines, with speeds measured in Sun-as-a-Star data of around 10 km s-1, and speeds in the flare excess signal of around 30 km s-1. Conclusions. All events showing upflows in Lyman lines are associated with some kind of eruption or coronal flow in imaging data, which may be responsible for the net blueshifts. Events showing downflows in the Lyman lines may be associated with loop contraction or faint downflows, but it is likely that chromospheric condensation flows are also contributing.},

abstract = {We discuss the use of measurements of the solar granulation contrast as a measure of optical quality. We demonstrate that for data recorded with a telescope that uses adaptive optics and/or post-processing to compensate for many low- and high-order aberrations, the RMS granulation contrast is directly proportional to the Strehl ratio calculated from the residual (small-scale) wavefront error (static and/or from seeing). We demonstrate that the wings of the high-order compensated point spread function for the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) are likely to extend to a radius of not more than about 2″, which is consistent with earlier conclusions drawn from stray-light compensation of sunspot images. We report on simultaneous measurements of seeing and solar granulation contrast averaged over 2 s time intervals at several wavelengths from 525 nm to 853.6 nm on the red-beam (CRISP beam) and wavelengths from 395 nm to 484 nm on the blue-beam (CHROMIS beam). These data were recorded with the SST, which has been revamped with an 85-electrode adaptive mirror and a new tip-tilt mirror, both of which were polished to exceptionally high optical quality. Compared to similar data obtained with the previous 37-electrode adaptive mirror in 2009 and 2011, there is a significant improvement in image contrast. The highest 2 s average image contrasts measured in April 2015 through 0.3−0.9 nm interference filters at 525 nm, 557 nm, 630 nm, and 853.5 nm with compensation only for the diffraction limited point spread function of SST are 11.8%, 11.8%, 10.2%, and 7.2%, respectively. Similarly, the highest 2 s contrasts measured at 395 nm, 400 nm, and 484 nm in May 2016 through 0.37−1.3 nm filters are 16%, 16%, and 12.5%, respectively. The granulation contrast observed with SST compares favorably to measured values with SOT on Hinode and with Sunrise as well as major ground-based solar telescopes. Simultaneously with the above wideband red-beam data, we also recorded narrowband continuum images with the CRISP imaging spectropolarimeter. We find that contrasts measured with CRISP are entirely consistent with the corresponding wideband contrasts, demonstrating that any additional image degradation by the CRISP etalons and telecentric optical system is marginal or even insignificant. Finally, we discuss the origin of the 48 nm RMS wavefront error needed to bring consistency between the measured granulation contrast and that obtained from 3D simulations of convection.},

abstract = {Using the "enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops" (EBTEL) model, we investigate the hydrodynamics of the plasma in a flaring coronal loop in which heat conduction is limited by turbulent scattering of the electrons that transport the thermal heat flux. The EBTEL equations are solved analytically in each of the two (conduction-dominated and radiation-dominated) cooling phases. Comparison of the results with typical observed cooling times in solar flares shows that the turbulent mean free-path $\lambda_T$ lies in a range corresponding to a regime in which classical (collision-dominated) conduction plays at most a limited role. We also consider the magnitude and duration of the heat input that is necessary to account for the enhanced values of temperature and density at the beginning of the cooling phase and for the observed cooling times. We find through numerical modeling that in order to produce a peak temperature $\simeq 1.5 \times 10^7$$\sim$K and a 200$\sim$s cooling time consistent with observations, the flare heating profile must extend over a significant period of time; in particular, its lingering role must be taken into consideration in any description of the cooling phase. Comparison with observationally-inferred values of post-flare loop temperatures, densities, and cooling times thus leads to useful constraints on both the magnitude and duration of the magnetic energy release in the loop, as well as on the value of the turbulent mean free-path $\lambda_T$.},

abstract = {Main sequence M stars pose an interesting problem for astrobiology: their abundance in our galaxy makes them likely targets in the hunt for habitable planets, but their strong chromospheric activity produces high-energy radiation and charged particles that may be detrimental to life. We studied the impact of the 1985 April 12 flare from the M dwarf AD Leonis (AD Leo), simulating the effects from both UV radiation and protons on the atmospheric chemistry of a hypothetical, Earth-like planet located within its habitable zone. Based on observations of solar proton events and the Neupert effect, we estimated a proton flux associated with the flare of 5.9×108 protons cm-2 sr-1 s-1 for particles with energies >10MeV. Then we calculated the abundance of nitrogen oxides produced by the flare by scaling the production of these compounds during a large solar proton event called the Carrington event. The simulations were performed with a 1-D photochemical model coupled to a 1-D radiative/convective model. Our results indicate that the UV radiation emitted during the flare does not produce a significant change in the ozone column depth of the planet. When the action of protons is included, the ozone depletion reaches a maximum of 94% two years after the flare for a planet with no magnetic field. At the peak of the flare, the calculated UV fluxes that reach the surface, in the wavelength ranges that are damaging for life, exceed those received on Earth during less than 100s. Therefore, flares may not present a direct hazard for life on the surface of an orbiting habitable planet. Given that AD Leo is one of the most magnetically active M dwarfs known, this conclusion should apply to planets around other M dwarfs with lower levels of chromospheric activity. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {The GOES X1.5 class flare that occurred on August 30, 2002 at 1327:30 UT\nis one of the few events detected so far at submillimeter wavelengths.\nWe present a detailed analysis of this flare combining radio\nobservations from 1.5 to 212 GHz (an upper limit of the flux is also\nprovided at 405 GHz) and X-ray. Although the observations of radio\nemission up to 212 GHz indicates that relativistic electrons with\nenergies of a few MeV were accelerated, no significant hard X-ray\nemission was detected by RHESSI above $\sim$250 keV. Images at 12-20 and\n50-100 keV reveal a very compact, but resolved, source of about $\sim$10\narcsec×10 arcsec. EUV TRACE images show a multi-kernel structure\nsuggesting a complex (multipolar) magnetic topology. During the peak\ntime the radio spectrum shows an extended flatness from $\sim$7 to 35 GHz.\nModeling the optically thin part of the radio spectrum as\ngyrosynchrotron emission we obtained the electron spectrum (spectral\nindex $\delta$, instantaneous number of emitting electrons). It is shown\nthat in order to keep the expected X-ray emission from the same emitting\nelectrons below the RHESSI background at 250 keV, a magnetic field above\n500 G is necessary. On the other hand, the electron spectrum deduced\nfrom radio observations ≥50 GHz is harder than that deduced from\n$\sim$70-250 keV X-ray data, meaning that there must exist a breaking energy\naround a few hundred keV. During the decay of the impulsive phase, a\nhardening of the X-ray spectrum is observed which is interpreted as a\nhardening of the electron distribution spectrum produced by the\ndiffusion due to Coulomb collisions of the trapped electrons in a medium\nwith an electron density of ne $\sim$ 3-5 × 1010\ncm-3.},

abstract = {We present high-resolution and multiline observations of a C2-class solar flare (SOL2019-05-06T08:47), which occurred in NOAA AR 12740 on May 6, 2019. The rise, peak, and decay phases of the flare were recorded continuously and quasi-simultaneously in the Ca II K line with the CHROMIS instrument and in the Ca II 8542 {\AA} and Fe I 6173 {\AA} lines with the CRISP instrument at the Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope. The observations in the chromospheric Ca II lines exhibit intense brightening near the flare footpoints. At these locations, a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium inversion code was employed to infer the temperature, magnetic field, line-of-sight (LOS) velocity, and microturbulent velocity stratification in the flaring atmosphere. The temporal analysis of the inferred temperature at the flare footpoints shows that the flaring atmosphere from log $\tau$ 500 ∼ −2.5 to −3.5 is heated up to 7 kK, whereas from log $\tau$ 500 ∼ −3.5 to −5 the inferred temperature ranges between ∼7.5 kK and ∼11 kK. During the flare peak time, the LOS velocity shows both upflows and downflows around the flare footpoints in the upper chromosphere and lower chromosphere, respectively. Moreover, the temporal analysis of the LOS magnetic field at the flare points exhibits a maximum change of ∼600 G. After the flare, the LOS magnetic field decreases to the non-flaring value, exhibiting no permanent or step-wise change. The analysis of response functions to the temperature, LOS magnetic field, and velocity shows that the Ca II lines exhibit enhanced sensitivity to the deeper layers (i.e., log $\tau$ 500 ∼ −3) of the flaring atmosphere, whereas for the non-flaring atmosphere they are mainly sensitive around log $\tau$ 500 ∼ −4. We suggest that a fraction of the apparent increase in the LOS magnetic field at the flare footpoints may be due to the increase in the sensitivity of the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line in the deeper layers, where the field strength is relatively strong. The rest may be due to magnetic field reconfiguration during the flare. In the photosphere, we do not notice significant changes in the physical parameters during the flare or non-flare times. Our observations illustrate that even a less intense C-class flare can heat the deeper layers of the solar chromosphere, mainly at the flare footpoints, without affecting the photosphere.},

Hydrodynamic properties, interpolation methods and other building blocks are described in abstract, modular, re-usable and combinable forms, which lets us generate versatile solvers from a small set of Paraiso source codes. We demonstrate Paraiso by implementing a compressive hydrodynamics solver.

abstract = {A method of calculating NLTE models of a plan-parallel solar flare atmosphere with stationary plasma flows is presented. To solve the radiative transfer equation, equations of statistical equilibrium (ESE) and the stationary momentum equation, we use the multilevel approximate lambda iteration (MALI) approach. The numerical code is based on the method recently developed by Rybicky & Hummer (1991, 1992) and allows to take into account macroscopic velocity fields in observer's frame formulation. The preconditioned ESE, constructed by this method, are finally linearized with respect to level populations and electron densities to treat the the hydrogen ionization balance. The numerical code based on this method is used to compute a grid of NLTE flare models with various velocity fields in order to show the influence of the velocity fields on the H$\alpha$-line asymmetries. The analysis of the results lead to conclusions that would improve interpretations of flare line asymmetries: 1) The velocities affect the level populations, 2) The type of asymmetry depends on the changes in the optical depth scales and on the run of the source function in the atmosphere. 3) A monotonous velocity affects only one wing of the line profile. 4) To get the velocity field from an observed profile the bisector method should be modified.},

abstract = {Microwave and hard x-ray spectra provide crucial information about energetic electrons and their environment in solar flares. These spectra are becoming better determined with the Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA) and the recent launch of the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The proposed Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR) promises even greater advances in radio observations of solar flares. Both microwave and hard x-ray spectra are sensitive to cutoffs in the electron distribution function. The determination of the high-energy cutoff from these spectra establishes the highest electron energies produced by the acceleration mechanism, while determination of the low-energy cutoff is crucial to establishing the total energy in accelerated electrons. This paper will show computations of the effects of both high- and low-energy cutoffs on microwave and hard x-ray spectra. The optically thick portion of a microwave spectrum is enhanced and smoothed by a low-energy cutoff, while a hard x-ray spectrum is flattened below the cutoff energy. A high-energy cutoff steepens the microwave spectrum and increases the wavelength at which the spectrum peaks, while the hard x-ray spectrum begins to steepen at photon energies roughly an order of magnitude below the electron cutoff energy. This work discusses how flare microwave and hard x-ray spectra can be analyzed together to determine these electron cutoff energies.

The geometry-specific parts of the radiative transfer solver are modularized so that the change of geometry is accomplished by simply setting the appropriate switch. We have also developed a parallel version of the code, in which we use a parallelization in spatial subdomains, and showed that such a scheme is sufficiently robust. We have performed a number of tests of the performance of the solver in all three geometries.

abstract = {This paper describes the first steps in the development of a new multi-dimensional time implicit code devoted to the study of hydrodynamical processes in stellar interiors. The code solves the hydrodynamical equations in spherical geometry and is based on the finite volume method. Radiation transport is taken into account within the diffusion approximation. Realistic equation of state and opacities are implemented, allowing study of a wide range of the problems characteristic of stellar interiors. We describe the numerical method and various standard tests performed to validate the method in detail. We present preliminary results devoted to describing stellar convection. We first performed a local simulation of convection in the surface layers of a A-type star model. This simulation tested the ability of the code to address stellar conditions and to validate our results, since they can be compared to similar previous simulations based on explicit codes. We then present a global simulation of turbulent convective motions in a cold giant envelope, covering 80% in radius of the stellar structure. Although our implicit scheme is unconditionally stable, we show that in practice there is a limitation on the time step that prevents the flow moving over several cells during a time step. Nevertheless, in the cold giant model we reach a hydro CFL number of 100. We also show that we are able to address flows with a wide range of Mach numbers (10-3 Ms 0.5), which is impossible with an anelastic approach. Our first developments are meant to demonstrate that applying an implicit scheme to a stellar evolution context is perfectly thinkable and to provide useful guidelines for optimising the development of an implicit multi-dimensional hydrodynamical code. {\textcopyright} 2011 ESO.},

abstract = {A comprehensive set of accurate atomic data is required for analyses of astrophysical and solar spectra. CHIANTI provides a database of atomic energy levels, wavelengths, radiative data and electron excitation data for ions which are abundant in cosmic plasmas. The most recent electron excitation data have been assessed and stored following the method of \cite[Burgess \& Tully (1992)]{bur92}. The current version is essentially complete for specifying the emission spectrum at wavelengths greater than 50 Angstroms. A list of observed lines in the spectral region between 50 and 1100 Angstroms has been compiled and compared with the lines predicted by the CHIANTI database. The CHIANTI database reproduces the vast majority of lines observed at these wavelengths. CHIANTI includes IDL (Interactive Data Language) routines to calculate optically thin synthetic spectra for equilibrium conditions. IDL routines to calculate theoretical line intensities required for electron density or temperature diagnostics and emission measure studies are also included. The CHIANTI atomic database and supporting IDL routines are available by anonymous FTP.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a brightness enhancement in the center of a large sunspot umbra at a wavelength of 3 mm using the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA). Sunspots are amongst the most prominent features on the solar surface, but many of their aspects are surprisingly poorly understood. We analyzed a {\lambda}=3 mm (100 GHz) mosaic image obtained by ALMA, which includes a large sunspot within the active region AR12470 on December 16, 2015. The 3 mm map has a field-of-view and spatial resolution, which is the highest spatial-resolution map of an entire sunspot in this frequency range. We find a gradient of 3 mm brightness from a high value in the outer penumbra to a low value in the inner penumbra/outer umbra. Within the inner umbra, there is a marked increase in 3mm brightness temperature, which we call an umbral brightness enhancement. This enhanced emission corresponds to a temperature excess of 800 K relative to the surrounding inner penumbral region and coincides with excess brightness in the 1330 and 1400 {\AA} slitjaw images of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), adjacent to a partial lightbridge. This {\lambda}=3 mm brightness enhancement may be an intrinsic feature of the sunspot umbra at chromospheric heights, such as a manifestation of umbral flashes, or it could be related to a coronal plume since the brightness enhancement was coincident with the footpoint of a coronal loop observed at 171 {\AA}.},

abstract = {The time dependence of atomic level populations in evolving plasmas is studied using an eigenfunction expansion of the non-LTE rate equations. The work aims to develop understanding without the need for, and as an aid to, numerical solutions. The discussion is mostly limited to linear systems, especially those for optically thin plasmas, but the implicitly non-linear case of non-LTE radiative transfer is briefly discussed. Eigenvalue spectra for typical atomic systems are examined using results compiled by Hearon. Diagonal dominance and sign symmetry of rate matrices show that just one eigenvalue is zero (corresponding to the equilibrium state), that the remaining eigenvalues have negative real parts, and that oscillations, if any, are necessarily damped. Gershgorin's theorems are used to show that many eigenvalues are determined by the radiative lifetimes of certain levels, because of diagonal dominance. With other properties, this demonstrates the existence of both "slow" and "fast" time-scales, where the "slow" evolution is controlled by properties of meta-stable levels. It is shown that, when collisions are present, Rydberg states contribute only "fast" eigenvalues. This justifies use of the quasi-static approximation, in which atoms containing just meta-stable levels can suffice to determine the atomic evolution on time-scales long compared with typical radiative lifetimes. Analytic solutions for two- and three-level atoms are used to examine the basis of earlier intuitive ideas, such as the "ionizing plasma" approximation. The power and limitations of Gershgorin's theorems are examined through examples taken from the solar atmosphere. The methods should help in the planning and interpretation of both experimental and numerical experiments in which atomic evolution is important. While the examples are astrophysical, the methods and results are applicable to plasmas in general. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {X-rays and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions from solar flares rapidly change the physical composition of the Earth's thermosphere and ionosphere, thereby causing space weather phenomena such as communication failures. Numerous empirical and physical models have been developed to estimate the effects of flare emissions on the Earth's upper atmosphere. We verified the reproduction of the flare emission spectra using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic calculation and the CHIANTI atomic database. To validate the proposed model, we used the observed EUV spectra obtained by the Extreme ultraviolet variability experiment (EVE) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We examined the “EUV flare time-integrated irradiance” and “EUV flare line rise time” of the EUV emissions for 21 events by comparing the calculation results of the proposed model and observed EUV spectral data. The proposed model successfully reproduced the EUV flare time-integrated irradiance of the Fe VIII 131 {\AA}, Fe XVIII 94 {\AA}, and Fe XX133 {\AA}, as well as the 55–355 {\AA} and 55–135 {\AA} bands. For the EUV flare line rise time, there was an acceptable correlation between the proposed model estimations and observations for all Fe flare emission lines. These results demonstrate that the proposed model can reproduce the EUV flare emission spectra from the emitting plasma with a relatively high formation temperature. This indicates that the physics-based model is effective for the accurate reproduction of the EUV spectral irradiance.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The code calculates spectra from 3D, 2D or 1D atmospheric models on a column-by-column basis (or 1.5D). While the 1.5D approximation breaks down in the cores of very strong lines in an inhomogeneous environment, it is nevertheless suitable for a large range of scenarios and allows for faster convergence with finer control over the iteration of each simulation column. The code scales well to at least tens of thousands of CPU cores, and is publicly available. In the present work we briefly describe its inner workings, strategies for convergence optimisation, its parallelism, and some possible applications.},

This requires a thick-target theory of the emission, for which the electron spectrum inferred from the x-ray spectrum become 1.5 powers steeper than in the usual thin-target theory.\nThe low-energy end of this spectrum contains enough energy above about 5 keV to supply the white-light continuum emission occasionally observed in major flares. The penetration of the nonthermal electrons creates long-lived excess ionization which enhances the free-free and free-bound continuum in the heated medium. The emission will occur high above the photopshere at small optical depth in the visible continuum. Thus its spectrum will extend into the infrared and ultraviolet.},

@article{RubioDaCosta2009,
abstract = {Context. L$\alpha$ is a strong chromospheric emission line, which has been relatively rarely observed in flares. The Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) has a broad Lyman a channel centered at 1216 {\AA} used primarily at the beginning of the mission. A small number of flares were observed in this channel. Aims.We aim to characterise the appearance and behaviour of a flare and filament ejection which occurred on 8th September 1999 and was observed by TRACE in L$\alpha$, as well as by the Yohkoh Soft and Hard X-ray telescopes. We explore the flare energetics and its spatial and temporal evolution. We have in mind the fact that the L$\alpha$ line is a target for the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging telescope (EUI) which has been selected for the Solar Orbiter mission, as well as the LYOT telescope on the proposed SMESE mission. Methods.We use imaging data from the TRACE 1216 {\AA}, 1600 {\AA} and 171 {\AA} channels, and the Yohkoh hard and soft X-ray telescopes. A correction is applied to the TRACE data to obtain a better estimate of the pure L$\alpha$ signature. The L$\alpha$ power is obtained from a knowledge of the TRACE response function, and the flare electron energy budget is estimated by interpreting Yohkoh/HXT emission in the context of the collisional thick target model. Results.We find that the L$\alpha$ flare is characterised by strong, compact footpoints (smaller than the UV ribbons) which correlate well with HXR footpoints. The L$\alpha$ power radiated by the flare footpoints can be estimated, and is found to be on the order of 1026 erg s-1 at the peak. This is less than 10% of the power inferred for the electrons which generate the co-spatial HXR emission, and can thus readily be provided by them. The early stages of the filament eruption that accompany the flare are also visible, and show a diffuse, roughly circular spreading sheet-like morphology, with embedded denser blobs. Conclusions.On the basis of this observation, we conclude that flare and filament observations in the L$\alpha$ line with the planned EUI and LYOT telescopes will provide valuable insight into solar flare evolution and energetics, especially when accompanied by HXR imaging and spectroscopy. {\textcopyright} 2009 ESO.},

@article{Rempel2016,
abstract = {We present a new version of the MURaM radiative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code that allows for simulations spanning from the upper convection zone into the solar corona. We implement the relevant coronal physics in terms of optically thin radiative loss, field aligned heat conduction, and an equilibrium ionization equation of state. We artificially limit the coronal Alfv{\'{e}}n and heat conduction speeds to computationally manageable values using an approximation to semi-relativistic MHD with an artificially reduced speed of light (Boris correction).We present example solutions ranging from quiet to active Sun in order to verify the validity of our approach. We quantify the role of numerical diffusivity for the effective coronal heating. We find that the (numerical) magnetic Prandtl number determines the ratio of resistive to viscous heating and that owing to the very large magnetic Prandtl number of the solar corona, heating is expected to happen predominantly through viscous dissipation. We find that reasonable solutions can be obtained with values of the reduced speed of light just marginally larger than the maximum sound speed. Overall this leads to a fully explicit code that can compute the time evolution of the solar corona in response to photospheric driving using numerical time steps not much smaller than 0.1 s. Numerical simulations of the coronal response to flux emergence covering a time span of a few days are well within reach using this approach. Key},

@article{Cheung2019,
abstract = {Solar and stellar flares are the most intense emitters of X-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation in planetary systems 1,2 . On the Sun, strong flares are usually found in newly emerging sunspot regions 3 . The emergence of these magnetic sunspot groups leads to the accumulation of magnetic energy in the corona. When the magnetic field undergoes abrupt relaxation, the energy released powers coronal mass ejections as well as heating plasma to temperatures beyond tens of millions of kelvins. While recent work has shed light on how magnetic energy and twist accumulate in the corona 4 and on how three-dimensional magnetic reconnection allows for rapid energy release 5,6 , a self-consistent model capturing how such magnetic changes translate into observable diagnostics has remained elusive. Here, we present a comprehensive radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulation of a solar flare capturing the process from emergence to eruption. The simulation has sufficient realism for the synthesis of remote sensing measurements to compare with observations at visible, ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. This unifying model allows us to explain a number of well-known features of solar flares 7 , including the time profile of the X-ray flux during flares, origin and temporal evolution of chromospheric evaporation and condensation, and sweeping of flare ribbons in the lower atmosphere. Furthermore, the model reproduces the apparent non-thermal shape of coronal X-ray spectra, which is the result of the superposition of multi-component super-hot plasmas 8 up to and beyond 100 million K.},

abstract = {Spectroscopic observations of solar flares provide critical diagnostics of the physical conditions in the flaring atmosphere. Some key features in observed spectra have not yet been accounted for in existing flare models. Here we report a data-driven simulation of the well-observed X1.0 flare on 2014 March 29 that can reconcile some well-known spectral discrepancies. We analyzed spectra of the flaring region from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in MgII h&k, the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectropolarimeter at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST/IBIS) in H$\alpha$ 6563 \AA\ and CaII 8542 \AA, and the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager (RHESSI) in hard X-rays. We constructed a multi-threaded flare loop model and used the electron flux inferred from RHESSI data as the input to the radiative hydrodynamic code RADYN to simulate the atmospheric response. We then synthesized various chromospheric emission lines and compared them with the IRIS and IBIS observations. In general, the synthetic intensities agree with the observed ones, especially near the northern footpoint of the flare. The simulated MgII line profile has narrower wings than the observed one. This discrepancy can be reduced by using a higher microturbulent velocity (27 km/s) in a narrow chromospheric layer. In addition, we found that an increase of electron density in the upper chromosphere within a narrow height range of $\approx$800 km below the transition region can turn the simulated MgII line core into emission and thus reproduce the single peaked profile, which is a common feature in all IRIS flares.},

abstract = {In many statistical solar flare studies, power laws are claimed and exponents derived by fitting a line to a log-log histogram. It is well known that this approach is statistically unstable, and very large statistics are needed to produce reliable exponent estimates. This may explain part of the observed divergence in power-law exponents in various studies. Moreover, the question is seldom addressed to what extent the data really do support power-law behavior. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of 6924 flares detected in SDO/AIA 9.4 nm images by the Solar Demon flare detection software between 2010 May 13 and 2018 March 16 and 9601 flares detected during the same period in GOES/XRS data by the LYRAFF flare detection software. We apply robust statistics to the SDO/AIA 9.4 nm peak intensity and the GOES/XRS raw peak flux, background-subtracted peak flux, and background-subtracted fluence and find clear indications that most background-corrected data are not well described by a power law and that all are better described by a lognormal distribution, while the raw GOES/XRS peak flux is best described by a power law. This may explain the success of power-law fits in flare studies using uncorrected data. The behavior of flare distributions has important implications for large-scale science questions such as coronal heating and the nature of solar flares. The apparent lognormal character of flare distributions in our data sets suggests that the assumed power-law nature of flares and its consequences need to be reexamined with great care.},

abstract = {We present a new system of two circular polarization solar radio telescopes, POEMAS, for observations of the Sun at 45 and 90 GHz. The novel characteristic of these instruments is the capability to measure circular right- and left-hand polarizations at these high frequencies. The two frequencies were chosen so as to bridge the gap at radio frequencies between 20 and 200 GHz of solar flare spectra. The telescopes, installed at CASLEO Observatory (Argentina), observe the full disk of the Sun with a half power beam width of 1. 4 {ring operator} , a time resolution of 10 ms at both frequencies, a sensitivity of 2 - 4 K that corresponds to 4 and 20 solar flux unit (=10 4 Jy), considering aperture efficiencies of 50±5 % and 75±8 % at 45 and 90 GHz, respectively. The telescope system saw first light in November 2011 and is satisfactorily operating daily since then. A few flares were observed and are presented here. The millimeter spectra of some flares are seen to rise toward higher frequencies, indicating the presence of a new spectral component distinct from the microwave one. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Solar flares are observed at all wavelengths from decameter radio waves to gamma-rays at 100 MeV. This review focuses on recent observations in EUV, soft and hard X-rays, white light, and radio waves. Space missions such as RHESSI, Yohkoh, TRACE, and SOHO have enlarged widely the observational base. They have revealed a number of surprises: Coronal sources appear before the hard X-ray emission in chromospheric footpoints, major flare acceleration sites appear to be independent of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), electrons, and ions may be accelerated at different sites, there are at least 3 different magnetic topologies, and basic characteristics vary from small to large flares. Recent progress also includes improved insights into the flare energy partition, on the location(s) of energy release, tests of energy release scenarios and particle acceleration. The interplay of observations with theory is important to deduce the geometry and to disentangle the various processes involved. There is increasing evidence supporting reconnection of magnetic field lines as the basic cause. While this process has become generally accepted as the trigger, it is still controversial how it converts a considerable fraction of the energy into non-thermal particles. Flare-like processes may be responsible for large-scale restructuring of the magnetic field in the corona as well as for its heating. Large flares influence interplanetary space and substantially affect the Earth's lower ionosphere. While flare scenarios have slowly converged over the past decades, every new observation still reveals major unexpected results, demonstrating that solar flares, after 150 years since their discovery, remain a complex problem of astrophysics including major unsolved questions.},

Thus, observations carried out in different wavelength bands reveal very different, seemingly incompatible properties. Not surprisingly, a debate is raging between supporters of the classical picture of the chromosphere as a nearly plane parallel layer exhibiting a gentle temperature rise from the photosphere to the transition region and proponents of a highly dynamical atmosphere that includes extremely cool gas. New data are required in order settle this issue. Here a brief overview of the structure and dynamics of the solar chromosphere is given, with particular emphasis on the chromospheric structure of the quiet Sun. The structure of the magnetic field is also briefly discussed, although filaments and prominences are not considered. Besides the observations, contrasting models are also critically discussed.},

abstract = {The well-established notion of a "common population" of the accelerated electrons simultaneously producing the hard X-ray (HXR) and the microwave (MW) emission during the flare impulsive phase has been challenged by some studies reporting the discrepancies between the HXR-inferred and the MW-inferred electron energy spectra. The traditional methods of their spectral inversion have some problems that can be mainly attributed to the unrealistic and the oversimplified treatment of the flare emission. To properly address this problem, we use a Non-linear Force Free Field (NLFFF) model extrapolated from an observed photospheric magnetogram as input to the three-dimensional, multi-wavelength modeling platform GX Simulator, and create a unified electron population model that can simultaneously reproduce the observed HXR and MW observations. We model the end of the impulsive phase of the 2015-06-22 M6.5 flare, and constrain the modeled electron spatial and energy parameters using observations made by the highest-resolving instruments currently available in two wavelengths, the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) for HXR and the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) for MW. Our results suggest that the HXR-emitting electron population model fits the standard flare model with a broken power-law spectrum (E_break $\sim$ 200 keV) that simultaneously produces the HXR footpoint emission and the MW high frequency emission. The model also includes an "HXR invisible" population of nonthermal electrons that are trapped in a large volume of magnetic field above the HXR-emitting loops, which is observable by its gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation emitting mainly in MW low frequency range.},

We use the evolving\ndistribution in the calculation of gyrosynchrotron emission, as an aid\nto interpretation of a particular microwave burst observed using the\nOwens Valley Solar Array (OVSA) during a GOES class C2.8 flare on 1993\nJune 3. The electrons are assumed to have a Gaussian pitch-angle\ndistribution, whose width and mean pitch angle are calculated as they\nevolve in time, taking into account the electron energy loss and a\nspecific magnetic loop structure set as a model for the target active\nregion. Various temporal behaviors of the microwave spectrum are found\nas a function of injection and trap conditions, which can be used to\ninfer some of the injection properties directly from the observed\nmicrowave spectra. As a main result we found that initial pitch-angle\ndistribution plays an important role in the microwave spectral\nevolution. This is largely due to the fact that pitch-angle diffusion of\nelectrons under Coulomb collisions markedly differs at those electron\nenergies to which the microwave spectrum is sensitive. This effect\ncannot be reproduced by adjusting the trap properties and therefore\ncould be used to determine whether the initial pitch-angle distribution\nis isotropic or narrowly beamed. The microwave burst spectra observed\nduring the 1993 June 3 flare are found to be most consistent with the\nhypothesis of an initially narrow beamed injection (<=30°) into a\nlow-density ($\sim$4×109 cm-3) magnetic trap.\nThis result explains the observed asymmetric microwave time curve\nconsisting of a relatively short rise ($\sim$32 s) and a long decay (>=5\nminutes) in terms of a transport effect rather than acceleration\ncharacteristics.

The approximation, which replaces the integral term over angle in the transfer equation by a quadrature sum, is studied; an estimate of the error involved is obtained and this error, which may be thought of as a further source or sink of photons (depending upon the sign), can then be used to evaluate a corection to the radiation field originally determined. This process may then be continued as a perturbation series. The method is found to give a final solution, when starting from the Eddington approximation, at least as accurate as that obtained using variable Eddington factors. Furthermore, the technique involves very little extra computing over that required using the Eddington approximation, and may be trivially generalized to any radiative transfer problem. It can also be used in conjunction with any of the existing methods for solving the equation of transfer. Examples are given in the context of spectral line formation in slab geometry. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

@article{Fletcher2007,
abstract = {The impulsive phase of a solar flare marks the epoch of rapid conversion of energy stored in the pre-flare coronal magnetic field. Hard X-ray observations imply that a substantial fraction of flare energy released during the impulsive phase is converted to the kinetic energy of mildly relativistic electrons (10-100 keV). The liberation of the magnetic free energy can occur as the coronal magnetic field reconfigures and relaxes following reconnection. We investigate a scenario in which products of the reconfiguration - large-scale Alfven wave pulses - transport the energy and magnetic-field changes rapidly through the corona to the lower atmosphere. This offers two possibilities for electron acceleration. Firstly, in a coronal plasma with beta < m_e/m_p, the waves propagate as inertial Alfven waves. In the presence of strong spatial gradients, these generate field-aligned electric fields that can accelerate electrons to energies on the order of 10 keV and above, including by repeated interactions between electrons and wavefronts. Secondly, when they reflect and mode-convert in the chromosphere, a cascade to high wavenumbers may develop. This will also accelerate electrons by turbulence, in a medium with a locally high electron number density. This concept, which bridges MHD-based and particle-based views of a flare, provides an interpretation of the recently-observed rapid variations of the line-of-sight component of the photospheric magnetic field across the flare impulsive phase, and offers solutions to some perplexing flare problems, such as the flare "number problem" of finding and resupplying sufficient electrons to explain the impulsive-phase hard X-ray emission.},

The virtues of the mixed-frame approach include simple velocity dependence with no velocity derivatives, straight characteristics, simple physical interpretation, and clear generalization to higher dimensions.

The first method makes use of an additional pre-processing auto-associative neural network to project the observed profile into the theoretical model subspace. The second method considers a suitable regularization of the neural network used for the inversion.

@article{Pinto2016,
abstract = {Context. Twisted magnetic fields should be ubiquitous in the solar corona, particularly in flare-producing active regions where the magnetic fields are strongly non-potential. The magnetic energy contained in such twisted fields can be released during solar flares and other explosive phenomena. It has recently been shown that reconnection in helical magnetic coronal loops results in plasma heating and particle acceleration distributed within a large volume, including the lower coronal and chromospheric sections of the loops. Hence, the magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration scenario involving magnetic helicity can be a viable alternative to the standard flare model, where particles are accelerated only in a small volume located in the upper corona. Aims: The key goal of this study is to investigate the links and observational signatures of plasma heating and particle acceleration in kink-unstable twisted coronal loops. Methods: We used a combination of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations and test-particle methods. These simulations describe the development of kink instability and magnetic reconnection in twisted coronal loops using resistive compressible MHD and incorporate atmospheric stratification and large-scale loop curvature. The resulting distributions of hot plasma let us estimate thermal X-ray emission intensities. With the electric and magnetic fields we obtained, we calculated electron trajectories using the guiding-centre approximation. These trajectories combined with the MHD plasma density distributions let us deduce synthetic hard X-ray bremsstrahlung intensities. Results: Our simulations emphasise that the geometry of the emission patterns produced by hot plasma in flaring twisted coronal loops can differ from the actual geometry of the underlying magnetic fields. In particular, the twist angles revealed by the emission threads (soft X-ray thermal emission; SXR) are consistently lower than the field-line twist present at the onset of the kink instability. Hard X-ray (HXR) emission that is due to the interaction of energetic electrons with the stratified background is concentrated at the loop foot-points in these simulations, even though the electrons are accelerated everywhere within the coronal volume of the loop. The maximum of the HXR emission consistently precedes that of SXR emission, with the HXR light curve being approximately proportional to the temporal derivative of the SXR light curve.},

@article{Eslamian2017,
abstract = {This paper aims to propose a new modified SPH method with novel treatments at the boundaries. Although SPH methods decrease contradictions due to grid distortions compared to traditional mesh-based methods, the penetration of particles through boundaries and the consistency problem make the simulation of problems with definite boundaries a concern. The use of ghost boundary particles and the insertion of artificial forces at the boundaries are the most popular boundary consistency treatments proposed thus far. The use of artificial forces causes the mixing of molecular and finite theories, which can violate the conservation of momentum. This paper shows how the use of ghost boundary particles can violate the continuity equation in problems with non-zero velocity divergence. This study proposes a novel ghost particle removed SPH (GR-SPH) method that discards all ghost particles and artificial forces at the boundaries. Liner layers and liner particles have been defined inside the domain instead of ghost boundary particles in such a way that the so-called violations can partially be remedied. Based on the continuity equation and kernel function unity specification, a novel truncation correction factor has been defined for density renormalization to override the consistency problem at the boundaries. In addition, a new method is proposed to detect the particles near complex wall boundaries and evaluate the normal distance from boundaries. Finally, some benchmark problems have been solved to show the capabilities of the new modified SPH method for the prediction of both particle location and pressure distribution with acceptable accuracy. The GR-SPH method facilitates programming, with fewer particles contributing to the computations. Comparison of its outcomes with published results shows that the new treatments executed at the boundaries are effective.},

abstract = {The weak field approximation (WFA) is a conceptually simple and computationally light method for inferring the magnetic field strength and its orientation in the Sun's atmosphere. In this work we study the validity and limitations of this tool when applied to full Stokes Ca ii 8542 {\AA} profiles to extract information about the chromospheric magnetic field. We find that the range of validity of the WFA depends, amongst other things, on the component of the magnetic field that one is trying to infer. The retrieval of line-of-sight component of the chromospheric magnetic field from the core of the spectral line is reliable for field strengths up to ∼ 1200 G, even when moderate velocity gradients are present. The horizontal component, on the other hand, is suitably derived using the wing-core boundary of the spectral line, but typically yields systematic errors of > 10%. The effects of scattering polarization further compound the problem by rendering the transverse field inference problematic in quiet Sun areas, and for observing geometries within 30◦ of the limb. Magneto-optical effects disproportionately challenge the determination of the magnetic field azimuth in the transverse plane, leading to errors of ∼ 10◦. Typical noise levels of $\sigma$n = 10−3 relative to the continuum intensity preclude the accurate retrieval of the transverse field strength and its azimuth below a threshold of a few hundred gauss. Striving for a noise level of $\sigma$n = 10−4 significantly improves the diagnostic capability of the WFA with this spectral line, at which point the magnetic field inference becomes limited by systematic errors.},

These quadratures are more suitable than the currently used ones for the numerical calculation of the radiation field tensors that are relevant in the problem of the generation and transfer of polarised radiation without assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium (non-LTE).

abstract = {The Yohkoh soft X-ray telescope has observed impulsive, thermal, soft X-ray emission at the footpoints of magnetic loops during solar flares. The soft X-ray (thermal) time profiles at the footpoints closely match the hard X-ray (nonthermal) time profiles, directly demonstrating the heating to the lower solar atmosphere on short timescales during the interval of nonthermal energy release. The phenomenon is the rule, rather than the exception, occurring in the majority of flares that we have examined with the Yohkoh data. We illustrate the impulsive behavior with data from the major flare of 1992 January 26. For this flare, the soft X-ray peak times matched the hard X-ray peak times within the time resolution of the soft X-ray measurements (about 10 s), and the soft and hard X-ray locations match within the resolution of the hard X-ray images. The impulsive soft X-ray emission clearly has a thermal spectral signature, but not at the high temperature of "superhot" source. We conclude that the impulsive soft X-ray emission comes from material heated by precipitating electrons at loop footpoints and evaporating from the deeper atmosphere into the flaring flux tube.},

abstract = {We introduce the "exponential linear unit" (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10% classification error for a single crop, single model network.},

@article{Brown1971,
abstract = {The derivation of dynamic spectra of high energy electrons in flares from high resolution hard x-ray obsrvations is considered. It is shown that the Bethe-Heitler formula for the electron-proton bremsstrahlung cross-section over the 20-100 keV range of energies admits of a general analytic solution for the electron spectrum in terms of the x-ray spectrum in a form convenient for computation. The bearing of this analysis on different models of flare conditions is considered. In examining the hypothesis that the x-rays are produced in regions of high ambient density, the duration of the burst being governed by modulation of the electron source rather than by the decay of trapped electrons injected impulsively, it is emphasized that the energy spectrum of the electrons at their source is different from their effective spectrum in the x-ray emitting region. This spectrum, at the source, is found to be much steeper than that in the x-ray region which means that the entire energy of the flare could reside in the inejcted electrons.},

abstract = {In [10], the authors have designed a new fifth order WENO finite-difference scheme by adding a higher order smoothness indicator which is obtained as a simple and inexpensive linear combination of the already existing low order smoothness indicators. Moreover, this new scheme, dubbed as WENO-Z, has a CPU cost which is equivalent to the one of the classical WENO-JS [2], and smaller than that of the mapped WENO-M, [5], since it involves no mapping of the nonlinear weights. In this article, we take a closer look at Taylor expansions of the Lagrangian polynomials of the WENO substencils and the related inherited symmetries of the classical lower order smoothness indicators to obtain a general formula for the higher order smoothness indicators that allows the extension of the WENO-Z scheme to all (odd) orders of accuracy. We further investigate the improved accuracy of the WENO-Z schemes at critical points of smooth solutions as well as their distinct numerical features as a result of the new sets of nonlinear weights and we show that regarding the numerical dissipation WENO-Z occupies an intermediary position between WENO-JS and WENO-M. Some standard numerical experiments such as the one dimensional Riemann initial values problems for the Euler equations and the Mach 3 shock density-wave interaction and the two dimensional double-Mach shock reflection problems are presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Soler2015,
abstract = {Alfv{\'{e}}nic waves are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere and their dissipation may play an important role in atmospheric heating. In the partially ionized solar chromosphere, collisions between ions and neutrals are an efficient dissipative mechanism for Alfv{\'{e}}n waves with frequencies near the ion-neutral collision frequency. The collision frequency is proportional to the ion-neutral collision cross section for momentum transfer. Here, we investigate Alfv{\'{e}}n wave damping as a function of height in a simplified chromospheric model and compare the results for two sets of collision cross sections, namely those of the classic hard-sphere model and those based on recent quantum-mechanical computations. We find important differences between the results for the two sets of cross sections. There is a critical interval of wavelengths for which impulsively excited Alfv{\'{e}}n waves are overdamped as a result of the strong ion- neutral dissipation. The critical wavelengths are in the range from 1 km to 50 km for the hard-sphere cross sections, and from 1 m to 1 km for the quantum-mechanical cross sections. Equivalently, for periodically driven Alfv{\'{e}}n waves there is an optimal frequency for which the damping is most effective. The optimal frequency varies from 1 Hz to 102 Hz for the hard-sphere cross sections, and from 102 Hz to 104 Hz for the quantum-mechanical cross sections. Future observations at sufficiently high spatial or temporal resolution may show the importance of high-frequency Alfv{\'{e}}n waves for chromospheric heating. For instance, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) may be able to detect the critical wavelengths and optimal frequencies and so to test the effective collision cross section in the chromospheric plasma.},

abstract = {We discuss the implications of the first systematic observations of solar flares at submillimeter wavelengths, defined here as observing wavelengths shorter than 3 mm (frequencies higher than 0.1 THz). The events observed thus far show that this wave band requires a new understanding of high-energy processes in solar flares. Several events, including observations from two different observatories, show during the impulsive phase of the flare a spectral component with a positive (increasing) slope at the highest observable frequencies (up to 405 GHz). To emphasize the increasing spectra and the possibility that these events could be even more prominent in the THz range, we term this spectral feature a ''THz component''. Here we review the data and methods, and critically assess the observational evidence for such distinct component(s). This evidence is convincing. We also review the several proposed explanations for these feature(s), which have been reported in three distinct flare phases. These data contain important clues to flare development and particle acceleration as a whole, but many of the theoretical issues remain open. We generally have lacked systematic observations in the millimeter-wave to far-infrared range that are needed to complete our picture of these events, and encourage observations with new facilities.},

In this scheme the radiation field is related to the source function by an approximate radiative transfer operator. This operator is used to set up the linearized nonlocal statistical equilibrium equations for the population numbers with small amounts of computing time. These equations have a characteristic and simple structure which enable a fast solution. The approximate statistical equilibrium equations are combined with the exact rate equations such that the final solution always is exact. The basic methods described can handle velocity fields, partial redistribution, and complex geometries and are ideal for future applications to the numerical solution of radiative hydrodynamics problems with radiation transport in lines and continua The methods form the basis of a non-LTE program that is more general than the often used code LINEAR-B. Calculations made so far indicate that the new method also is more stable and faster by typically a factor of ten. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new diagnostic tool for the inference of the thermal, dynamic, and magnetic properties of the solar chromosphere. It consists of a non-LTE inversion code of Stokes profiles induced by the Zeeman effect in magnetized stellar atmospheres. This code is the generalization, to the non-LTE Stokes transfer case, of the inversion code for unpolarized line profiles of Socas-Navarro, Ruiz Cobo, & Trujillo Bueno. It is based upon a full non-LTE multilevel treatment of Zeeman line transfer in which the thermal, magnetic, and dynamic properties of the atmospheric model are adjusted automatically by means of nonlinear least-squares-fitting techniques until a best fit to the observed Stokes profiles is obtained. Our non-LTE inversion approach is based on the concept of response functions, which measure the emergent Stokes profiles' first-order reaction to changes in the atmospheric parameters. We generalize our fixed departure coefficients (FDC) approximation in order to allow fast computation of such response functions in the present non-LTE Zeeman line transfer context. We present several numerical tests showing the reliability of our inversion method for retrieving the information about the thermodynamics and the magnetic field vector that is contained in the polarization state of the chosen spectral lines. We also explore the limitations of the inversion code by applying it to simulated observations where the physical hypotheses on which it is based on are not met. Finally, we apply our non-LTE Stokes inversion code to real spectropolarimetric observations of a sunspot observed in the IR triplet lines of Ca II. As a result, a new mean model of the sunspot chromosphere is provided.},

We find a power-law slope of $\alpha$F = 1.98 ± 0.11 for the (background- subtracted) soft X-ray peak fluxes that is invariant through three solar cycles and agrees with the theoretical prediction $\alpha$F = 2.0 of the fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model. For the soft X-ray flare rise times, we find a power-law slope of $\alpha$T = 2.02 ± 0.04 during solar cycle minima years, which is also consistent with the prediction $\alpha$T = 2.0 of the FD-SOC model. During solar cycle maxima years, the power-law slope is steeper in the range of $\alpha$T 2.0-5.0, which can be modeled by a solar-cycle-dependent flare pile-up bias effect. These results corroborate the FD-SOC model, which predicts a power-law slope of $\alpha$E = 1.5 for flare energies and thus rules out significant nanoflare heating. While the FD-SOC model predicts the probability distribution functions of spatio-temporal scaling laws of nonlinear energy dissipation processes, additional physical models are needed to derive the scaling laws between the geometric SOC parameters and the observed emissivity in different wavelength regimes, as we derive here for soft X-ray emission. The FD-SOC model also yields statistical probabilities for solar flare forecasting. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

abstract = {We propose a new numerical method to compute one-dimensional time-dependent wave propagation in stellar atmospheres that incorporates the time-dependent treatment of hydrogen ionization together with an evaluation of radiation losses under departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE). The method permits us to calculate acoustic waves and longitudinal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) tube waves. Wehave tested the method for the solar atmosphere by calculating the propagation of three types of waves, namely, a monochromatic acoustic wave, a stochastic acoustic wave, and a stochastic longitudinal tube wave. It was found that with a time-dependent treatment of the hydrogen ionization (as well as the Mg ionizations) the degree of ionization (H+/H) and theMgii/Mg ratio become insensitive to the temperature fluctuations, even in the presence of weak and moderately strong shocks. Only when strong shocks appear do the transition rates become large enough to cause a high correlation between the degree of ionization and the high post- shock temperatures. Our calculations show that a mean degree of ionization gets established that increases with height and is very little perturbed by the local temperature fluctuations of the wave.

abstract = {We use state-of-the-art radiation-MHD simulations and three-dimensional (3D) non-LTE radiative transfer computations to investigate H$\alpha$ line formation in the solar chromosphere and apply the results of this investigation to develop the potential of H$\alpha$ as a diagnostic of the chromosphere. We show that one can accurately model H$\alpha$ line formation assuming statistical equilibrium and complete frequency redistribution provided the computation of the model atmosphere included non-equilibrium ionization of hydrogen and the Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ line profiles are described by Doppler profiles. We find that 3D radiative transfer is essential in modeling hydrogen lines due to the low photon destruction probability in H$\alpha$. The H$\alpha$ opacity in the upper chromosphere is mainly sensitive to the mass density and only weakly sensitive to the temperature. We find that the H$\alpha$ line-core intensity is correlated with the average formation height: The larger the average formation height is, the lower the intensity will be. The line-core width is a measure of the gas temperature in the line-forming region. The fibril-like dark structures seen in H$\alpha$ line-core images computed from our model atmosphere are tracing magnetic field lines. These structures are caused by field-aligned ridges of enhanced chromospheric mass density that raise their average formation height, and therefore make them appear dark against their deeper-formed surroundings. We compare with observations, and find that the simulated line-core widths are very similar to the observed ones, without the need for additional microturbulence. {\textcopyright} 2012.

Recent studies of time-dependent radiative transfer have focused on radiation hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic effects without lines, or have solved time-independent equations for the radiation field simultaneously with time-dependent equations for the state of the medium. In this paper, we provide a fully time-dependent numerical solution to the radiative transfer and atomic rate equations for a medium irradiated by an external source of photons. We use accelerated Lambda iteration to achieve convergence of the radiation field and atomic states. We perform calculations for a three-level atomic model that illustrates important time-dependent effects. We demonstrate that our method provides an efficient, accurate solution to the time-dependent radiative transfer problem. Finally, we characterize astrophysical scenarios in which we expect our solutions to be important. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Numerical simulations of the dynamics and radiation in a solar {\~{N}}are loop are presented. The heating processes in the lower atmosphere include nonthermal heating by accelerated electrons and thermal soft X-ray irradiation from the {\~{N}}are-heated transition region and corona. Important transitions of hydrogen, helium, and singly ionized calcium and magnesium are treated in non-LTE. The principal results of the analysis are the following : 1. An impulsive event can be described as having two distinct dynamic phases, each with a deÐnite observational signature : an initial gentle phase, characterized by an atmospheric state of near-equilibrium, and a subsequent explosive phase, characterized by large material {\~{N}}ows and strong hydrody-namic waves and shocks. The amount of time the atmosphere remains in the gentle phase is determined by the level of nonthermal heating. Excess line emission produced during the gentle phase is not signiÐ-cantly Doppler-shifted, and the proÐles remain symmetric about their nominal line-center frequencies. Emission proÐles generated during the explosive phase can be highly Doppler-shifted and distorted, re{\~{N}}ecting the material motion and steep velocity gradients present at their depths of formation. 2. Hydrogen recombination radiation, from a high-temperature plateau formed during the gentle phase and from a chromospheric condensation formed during the explosive phase, is the primary cause of the white-light continuum brightening produced in the simulations. 3. A time lag is found between the brightening of the Paschen continuum and the brightening of the near wings of Ha, in the sense that the line wings brighten immediately, but the continuum Ðrst under-goes a slight dimming, followed eventually by a brightening. The continuum behavior is controlled by the trade-o between increased photoionization from enhanced populations of the excited states of hydrogen and increased electron density, which promotes recombination. 4. During the impulsive phase, when the accelerated electrons are directly heating the upper chromo-sphere, the contribution of the thermal soft X-rays to the overall energy balance in the lower atmosphere is negligible.},

abstract = {We measured the effect of clutch-size changes on levels of circulating prolactin (prl) among incubating male Wilson's Phalaropes in order to identify the influence of clutch-size as an exogenous determinant of circulating prl, and to better understand the endocrinology of clutch abandonment. One year of the study was characterized by unusually high temperatures and drought, and incubating males appeared to be heavily stressed based on ambient temperatures and rates of weight loss. We used the contrasting environmental conditions between years to compare levels of circulating prl among males experiencing different levels of environmental stress. We found a strong inter-year effect, with significantly lower prl during the high stress year. We also found a clear effect of clutch-size on level of circulating prl during the low stress year of the study. Males with increased or decreased clutch-size had lower levels of circulating prl than did control males. Because prl levels were so variable, we sought alternative explanations to year and clutch-size effects. We examined nine environmental and physiological factors a posteriori for a relationship with circulating prl. Although we identified weak correlates, none of the additional factors could account for the variation in prl explained by year and clutch-size. incubating male Wilson's Phalaropes appear to experience an adaptive endocrine change when the potential fitness of their clutch is compromised.},

abstract = {The chromospheric Lyman-alpha line of neutral hydrogen (Ly$\alpha$; 1216 {\AA}) is the strongest emission line in the solar spectrum. Fluctuations in Ly$\alpha$ are known to drive changes in planetary atmospheres, although few instruments have had the ability to capture rapid Ly$\alpha$ enhancements during solar flares. In this paper, we describe flare-associated emissions via a statistical study of 477 M- and X-class flares as observed by the Extreme UltraViolet Sensor on board the 15th Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, which has been monitoring the full-disk solar Ly$\alpha$ irradiance on 10-s timescales over the course of Solar Cycle 24. The vast majority (95%) of these flares produced Ly$\alpha$ enhancements of 10% or less above background levels, with a maximum increase of ∼30%. The irradiance in Ly$\alpha$ was found to exceed that of the 1–8 {\AA} X-ray irradiance by as much as two orders of magnitude in some cases, although flares that occurred closer to the solar limb were found to exhibit less of a Ly$\alpha$ enhancement. This center-to-limb variation was verified through a joint, stereoscopic observation of an X-class flare that appeared near the limb as viewed from Earth, but close to disk center as viewed by the MAVEN spacecraft in orbit around Mars. The frequency distribution of peak Ly$\alpha$ was found to have a power-law slope of 2.8±0.27. We also show that increased Ly$\alpha$ flux is closely correlated with induced currents in the ionospheric E-layer through the detection of the solar flare effect as observed by the Kakioka magnetometer.},

abstract = {Context. In studies of the solar spectrum compared to spectra of solar twin stars, it has been found that the chemical composition of the Sun seems to depart systematically from those of the twins. One possible explanation could be that the effect is caused by the special aspect angle of the Sun when observed from Earth compared with the aspect angles of the twins. This means that a latitude dependence of the solar spectrum, even with the heliocentric angle constant, could lead to the observed effects. Aims. We explore a possible variation in the strength of certain spectral lines that are used in the comparisons between the composition of the Sun and the twins at loci on the solar disk with different latitudes but at constant heliocentric angle. Methods. We use the TRIPPEL spectrograph at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope on La Palma to record spectra in five spectral regions to compare different locations on the solar disk at a heliocentric angle of 45°. Equivalent widths and other parameters are measured for fifteen different lines representing nine atomic species. Spectra acquired at different times are used in averaging the line parameters for each line and observing position. Results. The relative variations in equivalent widths at the equator and at solar latitude ∼45° are found to be less than 1.5% for all spectral lines studied. Translated into elemental abundances as they would be measured from a terrestrial and a hypothetical pole-on observer, the difference is estimated to be within 0.005 dex in all cases. Conclusions. It is very unlikely that latitude effects could cause the reported abundance difference between the Sun and the solar twins. The accuracy obtainable in measurements of small differences in spectral line strengths between different solar disk positions is very high, and can be exploited in studies of, e.g. weak magnetic fields or effects of solar activity on atmospheric structure. {\textcopyright} 2011 ESO.},

abstract = {The expressive power of neural networks is important for understanding deep learning. Most existing works consider this problem from the view of the depth of a network. In this paper, we study how width affects the expressiveness of neural networks. Classical results state that depth-bounded (e.g. depth-$2$) networks with suitable activation functions are universal approximators. We show a universal approximation theorem for width-bounded ReLU networks: width-$(n+4)$ ReLU networks, where $n$ is the input dimension, are universal approximators. Moreover, except for a measure zero set, all functions cannot be approximated by width-$n$ ReLU networks, which exhibits a phase transition. Several recent works demonstrate the benefits of depth by proving the depth-efficiency of neural networks. That is, there are classes of deep networks which cannot be realized by any shallow network whose size is no more than an exponential bound. Here we pose the dual question on the width-efficiency of ReLU networks: Are there wide networks that cannot be realized by narrow networks whose size is not substantially larger? We show that there exist classes of wide networks which cannot be realized by any narrow network whose depth is no more than a polynomial bound. On the other hand, we demonstrate by extensive experiments that narrow networks whose size exceed the polynomial bound by a constant factor can approximate wide and shallow network with high accuracy. Our results provide more comprehensive evidence that depth is more effective than width for the expressiveness of ReLU networks.},

abstract = {We present, for the first time, a self-consistent solution of the time-dependent 1D equations of non-LTE radiation hydrodynamics in solar chromospheric conditions. The vertical propagation of sinusoidal acoustic waves with periods of 30, 180, and 300 s is calculated. We find that departures from LTE and ionization recombination determine the temperature profiles of the shocks that develop. In LTE almost all the thermal energy goes into ionization, so the temperature rise is very small. In non-LTE, the finite transition rates delay the ionization to behind the shock front. The compression thus goes into thermal energy at the shock front leading to a high temperature amplitude. Further behind the shock front, the delayed ionization removes energy from the thermal pool, which reduces the temperature, producing a temperature spike.

abstract = {This letter reports on a set of full-Stokes spectropolarimetric observations in the near infrared He I 10830 A spectral region covering the pre-, flare, and post-flare phases of an M3.2 class solar flare. The flare originated on 2013 May 17 and belonged to active region NOAA 11748. We detected strong He I 10830 A emission in the flare. The red component of the He I triplet peaks at an intensity ratio to the continuum of about 1.86. During the flare, He I Stokes V is substantially larger and appears reversed compared to the usually larger Si I Stokes V profile. The photospheric Si I inversions of the four Stokes profiles reveal the following: (1) the magnetic field strength in the photosphere decreases or is even absent during the flare phase, as compared to the pre-flare phase. However, this decrease is not permanent. After the flare the magnetic field recovers its pre-flare configuration in a short time (i.e., in 30 minutes after the flare). (2) In the photosphere, the line-of-sight velocities show a regular granular up- and down-flow pattern before the flare erupts. During the flare, upflows (blueshifts) dominate the area where the flare is produced. Evaporation rates of $\sim$ $10^{-3}$ and $\sim$ $10^{-4}$ g cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ have been derived in the deep and high photosphere, respectively, capable of increasing the chromospheric density by a factor of two in about 400 seconds.},

abstract = {A method of second-order accuracy is described for integrating the equations of ideal compressible flow. The method is based on the integral conservation laws and is dissipative, so that it can be used across shocks. The heart of the method is a one-dimensional Lagrangean scheme that may be regarded as a second-order sequel to Godunov's method. The second-order accuracy is achieved by taking the distributions of the state quantities inside a gas slab to be linear, rather than uniform as in Godunov's method. The Lagrangean results are remapped with least-squares accuracy onto the desired Euler grid in a separate step. Several monotonicity algorithms are applied to ensure positivity, monotonicity and nonlinear stability. Higher dimensions are covered through time splitting. Numerical results for one-dimensional and two-dimensional flows are presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. The paper concludes with a summary of the results of the whole series "Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme.". ?? 1979.},

abstract = {The development of effective iterative methods capable of accurately solving NLTE Stokes transfer problems is of considerable importance for the investigation of solar and stellar magnetic fields. After briefly indicating the iterative approach which is being presently pursued for the exact solution of such problems, the particular regime where polarization signals can only be due to the Zeeman effect is considered in some detail. By means of NLTE Stokes transfer calculations for a two-level atomic model it is first shown that the currently-used field-free approximation (Rees, 1969) cannot be safely applied in the presence of magnetic field gradients. Such gradients lead to changes in the shape and width of the line profiles and they can produce non-negligible effects on the atomic level populations and line source functions. A new approximate method is then proposed, which does not require the actual solution of the Stokes vector transfer equation and is practically as fast as the field-free one. This polarization-free approximation provides a fairly good account of the effects of homogeneous and inhomogeneous magnetic fields on the statistical equilibrium and is very easy to implement in any existing non-magnetic, multi-level transfer code.},

abstract = {We present here RICH, a state-of-the-art two-dimensional hydrodynamic code based on Godunov's method, on an unstructured moving mesh (the acronym stands for Racah Institute Computational Hydrodynamics). This code is largely based on the code AREPO. It differs from AREPO in the interpolation and time-advancement schemeS as well as a novel parallelization scheme based on Voronoi tessellation. Using our code, we study the pros and cons of a moving mesh (in comparison to a static mesh). We also compare its accuracy to other codes. Specifically, we show that our implementation of external sources and time-advancement scheme is more accurate and robust than is AREPO when the mesh is allowed to move. We performed a parameter study of the cell rounding mechanism (Lloyd iterations) and its effects. We find that in most cases a moving mesh gives better results than a static mesh, but it is not universally true. In the case where matter moves in one wayand a sound wave is traveling in the other way (such that relative to the grid the wave is not moving) a static mesh gives better results than a moving mesh. We perform an analytic analysis for finite difference schemes that reveals that a Lagrangian simulation is better than aEulerian simulation in the case of a highly supersonic flow. Moreover, we show that Voronoi-based moving mesh schemes suffer from an error, which is resolution independent, due to inconsistencies between the flux calculation and the change in the area of a cell. Our code is publicly available as open source and designed in an object-oriented, user-friendly way that facilitates incorporation of new algorithms and physical processes.},

We discuss the atomic physics pertinent to h&k line formation, present a quintessential model atom that can be used in radiative transfer computations, and discuss the effect of partial redistribution (PRD) and 3D radiative transfer on the emergent line profiles. We conclude that Mg II h&k can be modeled accurately with a four-level plus continuum Mg II model atom. Ideally radiative transfer computations should be done in 3D including PRD effects. In practice this is currently not possible. A reasonable compromise is to use one-dimensional PRD computations to model the line profile up to and including the central emission peaks, and use 3D transfer assuming complete redistribution to model the central depression. {\textcopyright} 2013.

IRIS contains an imaging spectrograph that covers the Mg II h&k lines as well as a slit-jaw imager centered at Mg II k. Understanding the observations requires forward modeling of Mg II h&k line formation from three-dimensional (3D) radiation- magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) models. This paper is the second in a series where we undertake this modeling. We compute the vertically emergent h&k intensity from a snapshot of a dynamic 3D RMHD model of the solar atmosphere, and investigate which diagnostic information about the atmosphere is contained in the synthetic line profiles. We find that the Doppler shift of the central line depression correlates strongly with the vertical velocity at optical depth unity, which is typically located less than 200 km below the transition region (TR). By combining the Doppler shifts of the h and k lines we can retrieve the sign of the velocity gradient just below the TR. The intensity in the central line depression is anti-correlated with the formation height, especially in subfields of a few square Mm. This intensity could thus be used to measure the spatial variation of the height of the TR. The intensity in the line-core emission peaks correlates with the temperature at its formation height, especially for strong emission peaks. The peaks can thus be exploited as a temperature diagnostic. The wavelength difference between the blue and red peaks provides a diagnostic of the velocity gradients in the upper chromosphere. The intensity ratio of the blue and red peaks correlates strongly with the average velocity in the upper chromosphere. We conclude that the Mg II h&k lines are excellent probes of the very upper chromosphere just below the TR, a height regime that is impossible to probe with other spectral lines. They also provide decent temperature and velocity diagnostics of the middle chromosphere. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) routinely observes the Si IV resonance lines. When analyzing observations of these lines it has typically been assumed they form under optically thin conditions. This is likely valid for the quiescent Sun, but this assumption has also been applied to the more extreme flaring scenario. We used 36 electron beam driven radiation hydrodynamic solar flare simulations, computed using the RADYN code, to probe the validity of this assumption. Using these simulated atmospheres we solved the radiation transfer equations to obtain the non-LTE, non-equilibrium populations, line profiles, and opacities for a model Silicon atom, including charge exchange processes. This was achieved using the `minority species' version of RADYN. The inclusion of charge exchange resulted in a substantial fraction of Si IV at cooler temperatures than those predicted by ionisation equilibrium. All simulations with an injected energy flux $F>5\times10^{10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ resulted in optical depth effects on the Si IV emission, with differences in both intensity and line shape compared to the optically thin calculation. Weaker flares (down to $F\approx5\times10^{9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) also resulted in Si IV emission forming under optically thick conditions, depending on the other beam parameters. When opacity was significant, the atmospheres generally had column masses in excess of $5\times10^{-6}$ g cm$^{-2}$ over the temperature range $40$ to $100$ kK, and the Si IV formation temperatures were between $30$ and $60$ kK. We urge caution when analyzing Si IV flare observations, or when computing synthetic emission without performing a full radiation transfer calculation.},

abstract = {We propose a high-order finite difference weighted ENO (WENO) method for the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The proposed method is single-stage (i.e., it has no internal stages to store), single-step (i.e., it has no time history that needs to be stored), maintains a discrete divergence-free condition on the magnetic field, and has the capacity to preserve the positivity of the density and pressure. To accomplish this, we use a Taylor discretization of the Picard integral formulation (PIF) of the finite difference WENO method proposed in Christlieb et al. (2015) [23], where the focus is on a high-order discretization of the fluxes (as opposed to the conserved variables). We use the version where fluxes are expanded to third-order accuracy in time, and for the fluid variables space is discretized using the classical fifth-order finite difference WENO discretization. We use constrained transport in order to obtain divergence-free magnetic fields, which means that we simultaneously evolve the magnetohydrodynamic (that has an evolution equation for the magnetic field) and magnetic potential equations alongside each other, and set the magnetic field to be the (discrete) curl of the magnetic potential after each time step. In this work, we compute these derivatives to fourth-order accuracy. In order to retain a single-stage, single-step method, we develop a novel Lax-Wendroff discretization for the evolution of the magnetic potential, where we start with technology used for Hamilton-Jacobi equations in order to construct a non-oscillatory magnetic field. The end result is an algorithm that is similar to our previous work Christlieb et al. (2014) [8], but this time the time stepping is replaced through a Taylor method with the addition of a positivity-preserving limiter. Finally, positivity preservation is realized by introducing a parameterized flux limiter that considers a linear combination of high and low-order numerical fluxes. The choice of the free parameter is then given in such a way that the fluxes are limited towards the low-order solver until positivity is attained. Given the lack of additional degrees of freedom in the system, this positivity limiter lacks energy conservation where the limiter turns on. However, this ingredient can be dropped for problems where the pressure does not become negative. We present two and three dimensional numerical results for several standard test problems including a smooth Alfv{\'{e}}n wave (to verify formal order of accuracy), shock tube problems (to test the shock-capturing ability of the scheme), Orszag-Tang, and cloud shock interactions. These results assert the robustness and verify the high-order of accuracy of the proposed scheme.},

@article{Reep2019,
abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of the solar chromosphere is crucial to understanding energy transport across the solar atmosphere. The chromosphere is optically thick at many wavelengths and described by non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE), making it difficult to interpret observations. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence that the atmosphere is filamented, and that current instruments do not sufficiently resolve small scale features. In flares, it is likely that multithreaded models are required to describe the heating. The combination of NLTE effects and multithreaded modeling requires computationally demanding calculations, which has motivated the development of a model that can efficiently treat both. We describe the implementation of a solver in a hydrodynamic code for the hydrogen level populations that approximates the NLTE solutions. We derive an accurate electron density across the atmosphere, that includes the effects of non-equilibrium ionization for helium and metals. We show the effects on hydrodynamic simulations, which are used to synthesize light curves using a post-processing radiative transfer code. We demonstrate the utility of this model on IRIS observations of a small flare. We show that the Doppler shifts in Mg II, C II, and O I can be explained with a multithreaded model of loops subjected to electron beam heating, so long as NLTE effects are treated. The intensities, however, do not match observed values very well, which is due to assumptions about the initial atmosphere. We briefly show how altering the initial atmosphere can drastically alter line profiles, and therefore derived quantities, and suggest that it should be tuned to pre-flare observations.},

Iterations of the preconditioned equations, in conjunction with the transfer equation's formal solution, are used to solve linear equations. Some multilevel problems are considered, including an eleven-level neutral helium atom.

abstract = {Context. Response functions provide us with a quantitative measure of sensitivity of the emergent spectrum to perturbations in the solar atmosphere and are thus the method of choice for interpreting spectropolarimetric observations. For the lines formed in the solar chromosphere, it is necessary to compute these responses taking into account nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects. Aims. We show how to analytically compute the response of the level populations in NLTE to a change of a given physical quantity at a given depth in the atmosphere. These responses are then used to compute opacity and emissivity responses, which are then propagated to obtain the response of the emergent intensity. Methods. Our method is based on the derivative of the rate equations, where we explicitly incorporate spatial coupling in the radiative rate terms. After considering and collecting all interdependencies, the problem reduces to a linear system of equations with a dimension equal to the product of the number of spatial points and the number of energy levels. Results. We compare analytically computed response functions with those obtained using a finite difference approach and find very good agreement. In addition, a more accurate way of propagating opacity and emissivity perturbations through the numerical solution of the radiative transfer equation was developed. Conclusions. This method allows for the fast evaluation of the response of the emergent spectrum to perturbations of a given quantity at a given depth, and thus is a significant step towards more efficient NLTE inversions.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration due to the kink instability in twisted coronal loops can be a viable scenario for confined solar flares. Detailed investigation of this phenomenon requires reliable methods for observational detection of magnetic twist in solar flares, which may not be possible solely through extreme UV and soft X-ray thermal emission. The gradient of microwave polarisation across flaring loops can serve as one of the detection criteria. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of magnetic twist in flaring coronal loops on the polarisation of gyro-synchrotron microwave emission, and determine whether microwave emission polarisation could provide a means for observational detection. We use time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic and test-particle models, developed using LARE3D and GCA codes to investigate twisted coronal loops relaxing following the kink-instability, and calculate synthetic microwave emission maps (I and V Stokes components) using GX simulator. It is found that flaring twisted coronal loops would yield some characteristic observational patterns, such as a gradient of Stokes V parameter across the loop. However, these patterns may be visible only for a relatively short period of time due to fast magnetic reconfiguration after the instability. We find that normally they will be visible for only a minute after onset of magnetic reconnection (or after the beginning of the impulsive phase). The visibility will also depend on the orientation and position of the loop on solar disk. Typically, it would be difficult to see the characteristic polarisation pattern if the twisted loop is seen from the top (close to the centre of the solar disk), but easier if the twisted loop is seen from the side (i.e. observed very close to the limb).},

abstract = {On 2012 June 17, we observed the evolution of a C-class flare associated with the eruption of a filament near a large sunspot in the active region NOAA 11504. We obtained high spatial resolution filtergrams using the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory in broadband TiO at 706 nm (bandpass: 10 {\AA}) and He I 10830 {\AA} narrow band (bandpass: 0.5 {\AA}, centered 0.25 {\AA} to the blue). We analyze the spatio-temporal behavior of the He I 10830 {\AA} data, which were obtained over a 90″×90″ field of view with a cadence of 10 s. We also analyze simultaneous data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment instruments on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft, and data from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager and GOES spacecrafts. Non-thermal effects are ignored in this analysis. Several quantitative aspects of the data, as well as models derived using the "0D" enthalpy-based thermal evolution of loops model code, indicate that the triplet states of the 10830 {\AA} multiplet are populated by photoionization of chromospheric plasma followed by radiative recombination. Surprisingly, the He II 304 {\AA} line is reasonably well matched by standard emission measure calculations, along with the C IV emission which dominates the Atmosphere Imaging Assembly 1600 {\AA} channel during flares. This work lends support to some of our previous work combining X-ray, EUV, and UV data of flares to build models of energy transport from corona to chromosphere.},

abstract = {The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) has routinely observed the flaring Mg II NUV spectrum, offering excellent diagnostic potential and a window into the location of energy deposition. A number of studies have forward modelled both the general properties of these lines and specific flare observations. Generally these have forward modelled radiation via post-processing of snapshots from hydrodynamic flare simulations through radiation transfer codes. There has, however, not been a study of how the physics included in these radiation transport codes affects the solution. A baseline setup for forward modelling MgII in flares is presented and contrasted with approaches that add or remove complexity. It is shown for Mg II: (1) PRD is still required during flare simulations despite the increased densities, (2) using full angle-dependent PRD affects the solution but takes significantly longer to process a snapshot, (3) including Mg I in NLTE results in negligible differences to the Mg II lines but does affect the NUV quasi-continuum, (4) only hydrogen and Mg II need to be included in NLTE, (5) ideally the non-equilibrium hydrogen populations, with non-thermal collisional rates, should be used rather than the statistical equilibrium populations, (6) an atom consisting of only the ground state, h & k upper levels, and continuum level is insufficient to model the resonance lines, and (7) irradiation from a hot, dense flaring transition region can affect the formation of Mg II. We discuss modifications to the RH code allowing straightforward inclusion of transition region and coronal irradiation in flares.},

We show that the time scale for ionization/recombination can be estimated from the eigenvalues of a modified rate matrix where the optically thick Lyman transitions that are in detailed balance have been excluded. We find that the time scale for ionization/recombination is dominated by the slow collisional leakage from the ground state to the first excited state. Throughout the chromosphere the time scale is long ($10^3$-$10^5$ s), except in shocks where the increased temperature and density shorten the time scale for ionization/recombination, especially in the upper chromosphere. Because the relaxation time scale is much longer than dynamic time scales, hydrogen ionization does not have time to reach its equilibrium value and its fluctuations are much smaller than the variation of its statistical equilibrium value appropriate for the instantaneous conditions. The ionization state tends to represent the higher temperature of the shocks, and the mean electron density is up to a factor of six higher than the electron density calculated in statistical equilibrium from the mean atmosphere. The simulations show that a static picture and a dynamic picture of the chromosphere are fundamentally different and that time variations are crucial for our understanding of the chromosphere itself and the spectral features formed there.},

abstract = {The concept of the redistribution function, which was originally introduced in order to describe a correlation between frequencies and directions of the absorbed and emitted photon in resonance scattering, has been extended to other resonance two-photon processes including resonance Raman scattering, resonance two-photon absorption and emission, and inverse Raman scattering. We have derived, within the frame of the impact approximation, the appropriate form of the generalized redistribution function. Using a suitable formalism, the generalized redistribution function takes the same form for all types of two-photon processes and contains all the redistribution functions, considered previously, as various limiting cases. In analogy to Hummer's original scheme of redistribution functions, we have derived a similar set of generalized redistribution functions, denoted as pi(i = I, II, III, IV, V), and we have shown that the most general case is described by a linear combination of pIII and pV, analogously to the previous results. Explicit formulae for the velocity-averaged (laboratory-frame) generalized redistribution functions pi(i = I, II, III, IV, V) are given and possible numerical methods for their evaluation are briefly indicated. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {While solar flares are predominantly characterised by an intense broadband enhancement to the solar radiative output, certain spectral lines and continua will, in theory, exhibit flare-induced dimmings. Observations of transitions of orthohelium He I $\lambda\lambda 10830${\AA} and the He I D3 lines have shown evidence of such dimming, usually followed by enhanced emission. It has been suggested that non-thermal collisional ionisation of helium by an electron beam, followed by recombinations to orthohelium, is responsible for overpopulating the those levels, leading to stronger absorption. However it has not been possible observationally to preclude the possibility of overpopulating orthohelium via enhanced photoionisation of He I by EUV irradiance from the flaring corona followed by recombinations. Here we present radiation hydrodynamics simulations of non-thermal electron beam-driven flares where (1) both non-thermal collisional ionisation of Helium and coronal irradiance are included, and (2) only coronal irradiance is included. A grid of simulations covering a range of total energies deposited by the electron beam, and a range of non-thermal electron beam low-energy cutoff values, were simulated. In order to obtain flare-induced dimming of the He I 10830{\AA} line it was necessary for non-thermal collisional ionisations to be present. The effect was more prominent in flares with larger low-energy cutoff values and longer lived in weaker flares and flares with a more gradual energy deposition timescale. These results demonstrate the usefulness of orthohelium line emission as a diagnostic of flare energy transport.},

abstract = {We develop a time-dependent, multi-group, multi-dimensional relativistic radiative transfer code, which is required to numerically investigate radiation from relativistic fluids that are involved in, e.g., gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. The code is based on the spherical harmonic discrete ordinate method (SHDOM) which evaluates a source function including anisotropic scattering in spherical harmonics and implicitly solves the static radiative transfer equation with ray tracing in discrete ordinates. We implement treatments of time dependence, multi-frequency bins, Lorentz transformation, and elastic Thomson and inelastic Compton scattering to the publicly available SHDOM code. Our code adopts a mixed-frame approach; the source function is evaluated in the comoving frame, whereas the radiative transfer equation is solved in the laboratory frame. This implementation is validated using various test problems and comparisons with the results from a relativistic Monte Carlo code. These validations confirm that the code correctly calculates the intensity and its evolution in the computational domain. The code enables us to obtain an Eddington tensor that relates the first and third moments of intensity (energy density and radiation pressure) and is frequently used as a closure relation in radiation hydrodynamics calculations.},

abstract = {This review surveys hard X-ray emissions of non-thermal electrons in the solar corona. These electrons originate in flares and flare-related processes. Hard X-ray emission is the most direct diagnostic of electron presence in the corona, and such observations provide quantitative determinations of the total energy in the nonthermal electrons. The most intense flare emissions are generally observed from the chromosphere at footpoints of magnetic loops. Over the years, however, many observations of hard X-ray and even y-ray emission directly from the corona have also been reported. These coronal sources are of particular interest as they occur closest to where the electron acceleration is thought to occur. Prior to the actual direct imaging observations, disk occultation was usually required to study coronal sources, resulting in limited physical information. Now RHESSI 1 has given us a systematic view of coronal sources that combines high spatial and spectral resolution with broad energy coverage and high sensitivity. Despite the low density and hence low brems Strahlung efficiency of the corona, we now detect coronal hard X-ray emissions from, sources in all. phases of solar flares. Because the physical, conditions in such sources may differ substantially from those of the usual "footpoint" emission regions, we take the opportunity to revisit the physics of hard X-radiation and relevant theories of particle acceleration. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2008.},

Energy fluxes in our calculations range from 109 ergs cm-2 s-1 to 1011 ergs cm-2 s-1. We have improved on previous hydrodynamic flare calculations by taking into account optically thick losses in the flare chromosphere, by spatially resolving the flare transition region, and by self-consistently accounting for conductive flux saturation. In this paper we describe in detail the physics assumed in the calculations, as well as details of our numerical techniques not described in Paper I of this series. We show results of these calculations by displaying the temperature, density, pressure, and velocity at select- ed times for a range of energy fluxes. We find that an energy flux threshold separates two regimes of hydrody- namic behavior. Very little chromospheric evaporation occurs at low energy fluxes, while rapid, explosive evaporation occurs at high energy fluxes. Only explosive evaporation is accompanied by the formation of locally cool, dense “ condensations ” in the flare chromosphere. The subsequent two papers of this series are devoted to a detailed account of the simulation results and aim to elucidate the physical mechanisms at work in the simulations introduced in this paper.},

abstract = {We perform a hydrodynamic simulation of a cooling coronal loop and calculate the time-dependent ion populations of the most abundant elements of the solar atmosphere at each time-step. We couple the time-dependent ion balance equations to the hydrodynamic equations in order to treat the energy loss through radiation in a self-consistent way by allowing for the emission from a potentially nonequilibrium ion population. We present results for the response to the changing conditions in the loop of the population of C VII ions and find significant deviations from equilibrium in the coronal and footpoint regions of the loop. The former is due to the tenuous nature of the coronal plasma causing recombinations to be rare and the latter is due to the strong downflows that develop as the loop cools, which carry persistent C VII ions into the lower regions of the loop. We also present a comparison between total plasma emissivity curves calculated during this simulation and an almost identical simulation that assumed an equilibrium ion population for the calculation of the radiation term. As a result of the nonequilibrium ion populations we find significant differences between the emissivity curves of each simulation and the loop cooling times. We suggest that a consideration of nonequilibrium ionisation and radiation might help to (a) explain the thermal broadening observed in some emission lines during explosive events, and (b) reconcile differences between theory and observations relating to the longevity of some loops observed in the TRACE filters.},

Depending on the value of the mean free path $\lambda$T associated with the turbulent scattering process, we identify four main cooling scenarios. The overall temperature evolution, from an initial temperature in excess of 107 K, is modeled in each case, highlighting the evolution of the dominant cooling mechanism throughout the cooling process. Comparison with observed cooling times allows the value of $\lambda$T to be constrained, and interestingly this range corresponds to situations where collision-dominated conduction plays a very limited role, or even no role at all, in the cooling of post-flare coronal loops.},

abstract = {Solar flares observed in the 200-400 GHz radio domain may exhibit a slowly varying and time-extended component which follows a short (few minutes) impulsive phase and which lasts for a few tens of minutes to more than one hour. The few examples discussed in the literature indicate that such long-lasting submillimeter emission is most likely thermal bremsstrahlung. We present a detailed analysis of the time-extended phase of the 2003 October 27 (M6.7) flare, combining 1-345 GHz total-flux radio measurements with X-ray, EUV, and H{\alpha} observations. We find that the time-extended radio emission is, as expected, radiated by thermal bremsstrahlung. Up to 230 GHz, it is entirely produced in the corona by hot and cool materials at 7-16 MK and 1-3 MK, respectively. At 345 GHz, there is an additional contribution from chromospheric material at a few 10^4 K. These results, which may also apply to other millimeter-submillimeter radio events, are not consistent with the expectations from standard semi-empirical models of the chromosphere and transition region during flares, which predict observable radio emission from the chromosphere at all frequencies where the corona is transparent.},

abstract = {The interpretation of the intensity and polarization of the spectral line radiation produced in the atmosphere of the Sun and of other stars requires solving a radiative transfer problem that can be very complex, especially when the main interest lies in modeling the spectral line polarization produced by scattering processes and the Hanle and Zeeman effects. One of the difficulties is that the plasma of a stellar atmosphere can be highly inhomogeneous and dynamic, which implies the need to solve the non-equilibrium problem of the generation and transfer of polarized radiation in realistic three-dimensional (3D) stellar atmospheric models. Here we present PORTA, an efficient multilevel radiative transfer code we have developed for the simulation of the spectral line polarization caused by scattering processes and the Hanle and Zeeman effects in 3D models of stellar atmospheres. The numerical method of solution is based on the non-linear multigrid iterative method and on a novel short-characteristics formal solver of the Stokes-vector transfer equation which uses monotonic B{\'{e}}zier interpolation. Therefore, with PORTA the computing time needed to obtain at each spatial grid point the self-consistent values of the atomic density matrix (which quantifies the excitation state of the atomic system) scales linearly with the total number of grid points. Another crucial feature of PORTA is its parallelization strategy, which allows us to speed up the numerical solution of complicated 3D problems by several orders of magnitude with respect to sequential radiative transfer approaches, given its excellent linear scaling with the number of available processors. The PORTA code can also be conveniently applied to solve the simpler 3D radiative transfer problem of unpolarized radiation in multilevel systems. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2013.},

abstract = {The effect of the numerical spatial resolution in models of the solar corona and corona / chromosphere interface is examined for impulsive heating over a range of magnitudes using one dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. It is demonstrated that the principle effect of inadequate resolution is on the coronal density. An underresolved loop typically has a peak density of at least a factor of two lower than a resolved loop subject to the same heating, with larger discrepencies in the decay phase. The temperature for under-resolved loops is also lower indicating that lack of resolution does not "bottle up" the heat flux in the corona. Energy is conserved in the models to under 1% in all cases, indicating that this is not responsible for the low density. Instead, we argue that in under-resolved loops the heat flux "jumps across" the transition region to the dense chromosphere from which it is radiated rather than heating and ablating transition region plasma. This emphasises the point that the interaction between corona and chromosphere occurs only through the medium of the transition region. Implications for three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic coronal models are discussed.},

abstract = {Microwave emission of solar flares is formed primarily by incoherent gyrosynchrotron radiation generated by accelerated electrons in coronal magnetic loops. The resulting emission depends on many factors, including pitch-angle distribution of the emitting electrons and the source geometry. In this work, we perform systematic simulations of solar microwave emission using recently developed tools (GS Simulator and fast gyrosynchrotron codes) capable of simulating maps of radio brightness and polarization as well as spatially resolved emission spectra. A 3D model of a symmetric dipole magnetic loop is used. We compare the emission from isotropic and anisotropic (of loss-cone type) electron distributions. We also investigate effects caused by inhomogeneous distribution of the emitting particles along the loop. It is found that effect of the adopted moderate electron anisotropy is the most pronounced near the footpoints and it also depends strongly on the loop orientation. Concentration of the emitting particles at the loop top results in a corresponding spatial shift of the radio brightness peak, thus reducing effects of the anisotropy. The high-frequency (around 50 GHz) emission spectral index is specified mainly by the energy spectrum of the emitting electrons; however, at intermediate frequencies (around 10-20 GHz), the spectrum shape is strongly dependent on the electron anisotropy, spatial distribution, and magnetic field nonuniformity. The implications of the obtained results for the diagnostics of the energetic electrons in solar flares are discussed.},

@article{Gouttebroze2002,
abstract = {If there is one key element in the social psychology of behaviour that is still missing from Stern's ABC model, it is the role of habit. Stern (2000) acknowledges this and proposes that an integrated model of environmentally significant behaviour would consist of four factors: 1) attitudes; 2) contextual factors; 3) personal capabilities; and 4) habits. The general thrust of Stern's suggestion is very similar to an attempt made almost thirty years ago by social psychologist Harry Triandis to develop an integrated model of 'interpersonal' behaviour. Triandis recognised the key role played by both social factors and emotions in forming intentions. He also highlighted the importance of past behaviour on the present. On the basis of these observations, Triandis proposed a Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (Figure 4) in which intentions – as in many of the other models – are immediate antecedents of behaviour. But crucially, habits also mediate behaviour. And both these influences are moderated by facilitating conditions. Behaviour in any situation is, according to Triandis, a function partly of the intention, partly of the habitual responses, and partly of the situational constraints and conditions. The intention is influenced by social and affective factors as well as by rational deliberations. One is neither fully deliberative, in Triandis' model, nor fully automatic. One is neither fully autonomous nor entirely social. Behaviour is influenced by moral beliefs, but the impact of these is moderated both by emotional drives and cognitive limitations. Social factors include norms, roles and self-concept. Norms are the social rules about what should and should not be done. Roles are 'sets of behaviours that are considered appropriate for persons holding particular positions in a group' (Triandis, 1977). Self-concept refers to the idea that a person has of his/herself, the goals that it is appropriate for the person to pursue or to eschew, and the behaviours that the person does or does not engage in. Emotional responses to a decision or to a decision situation are assumed distinct from rational-instrumental evaluations of consequences, and may include both positive and negative emotional responses of varying strengths. Affect has a more or less unconscious input to decision-making, and is governed by instinctive behavioural responses to particular situations. Figure 3 Triandis' Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour Triandis offers an explicit role for affective factors on behavioural intentions. In more recent writings, the attempt to incorporate emotional antecedents into a model of action has received a lot of support (Bagozzi et al., 2002, Steg et al., 2001). Triandis theory of interpersonal behaviour captures many of the criticisms levelled at rational choice theory in a way that is not done by some of the other models. It also can be, and has been, used as a framework for empirical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the component factors in different kinds of situations. It also can be, and has been, used as the framework for empirical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the component factors in different kinds of situations. Far less use has been made of Triandis work than was made of the Ajzen-Fishbein work. However, where it has been used, it appears to have additional explanatory value over Ajzen's model, in particular, by including role beliefs and habits. Affect},

The techniques are tested on data obtained at high spatial resolution from the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS) grating spectrograph at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and from the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) instrument at the Dunn Solar Telescope. The method robustly deconvolves wide spectral transmission profiles for fields of view sampling a variety of solar structures (granulation, plage and pores) with a photometrical precision of less than 1%. The results and fidelity of the method are tested on data from IBIS obtained using several different spectral resolution modes. The method, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is extremely fast, performing about $10^5$ deconvolutions per second on a CPU and $10^6$ deconvolutions per second on NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU for a spectrum with 40 wavelength samples. This approach is applicable for deconvolving large amounts of data from instruments with wide spectral transmission profiles, such as the Visible Tunable Filter (VTF) on the DKI Solar Telescope (DKIST). We also investigate its application to future instruments by recovering spectral line profiles obtained with a theoretical multi-peaked spectral transmission profile. We further discuss the limitations of this deconvolutional approach through the analysis of the dimensionality of the original and multiplexed data.},

abstract = {The broadening of the hydrogen lines during flares is thought to result from increased charge (electron, proton) density in the flare chromosphere. However, disagreements between theory and modeling prescriptions have precluded an accurate diagnostic of the degree of ionization and compression resulting from flare heating in the chromosphere. To resolve this issue, we have incorporated the unified theory of electric pressure broadening of the hydrogen lines into the non-LTE radiative transfer code RH. This broadening prescription produces a much more realistic spectrum of the quiescent, A0 star Vega compared to the analytic approximations used as a damping parameter in the Voigt profiles. We test recent radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of the atmospheric response to high nonthermal electron beam fluxes with the new broadening prescription and find that the Balmer lines are over-broadened at the densest times in the simulations. Adding many simultaneously heated and cooling model loops as a "multithread" model improves the agreement with the observations. We revisit the three-component phenomenological flare model of the YZ CMi Megaflare using recent and new RHD models. The evolution of the broadening, line flux ratios, and continuum flux ratios are well-reproduced by a multithread model with high-flux nonthermal electron beam heating, an extended decay phase model, and a "hot spot" atmosphere heated by an ultrarelativistic electron beam with reasonable filling factors: 0.1%, 1%, and 0.1% of the visible stellar hemisphere, respectively. The new modeling motivates future work to understand the origin of the extended gradual phase emission.},

The flare SOL2012-03-09T03:53 (M6.4) shows clear\nevidence for an irreversible (stepwise) coronal implosion.\nExtreme-ultraviolet (EUV) images show at least four groups of coronal\nloops at different heights overlying the flaring core undergoing fast\ncontraction during the impulsive phase of the flare. These contractions\nstart around a minute after the flare onset, and the rate of contraction\nis closely associated with the intensity of the hard X-ray and microwave\nemissions. They also seem to have a close relationship with the dimming\nassociated with the formation of the coronal mass ejection and a global\nEUV wave. Several studies now have detected contracting motions in the\ncorona during solar flares that can be interpreted as the implosion\nnecessary to release energy. Our results confirm this, and tighten the\nassociation with the flare impulsive phase. We add to the phenomenology\nby noting the presence of oscillatory variations revealed by\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite soft X-rays (SXR) and\nspatially integrated EUV emission at 94 and 335 angstrom. We identify\npulsations of approximate to 60 s in SXR and EUV data, which we\ninterpret as persistent, semi-regular compressions of the flaring core\nregion which modulate the plasma temperature and emission measure. The\nloop oscillations, observed over a large region, also allow us to\nprovide rough estimates of the energy temporarily stored in the\neigenmodes of the active-region structure as it approaches its new\nequilibrium.},

abstract = {A new iterative method for solving non-LTE multilevel radiative transfer (RT) problems in 1D, 2D or 3D geometries is presented. The scheme obtains the self-consistent solution of the kinetic and RT equations at the cost of only a few (< 10) formal solutions of the RT equation. It combines, for the first time, non-linear multigrid iteration (Brandt, 1977; Hackbush, 1985), an efficient multilevel RT scheme based on Gauss-Seidel iterations (cf. Trujillo Bueno & Fabiani Bendicho, 1995), and accurate short-characteristics formal solution techniques. By combining a valid stopping criterion with a nested-grid strategy a converged solution with the desired true error is automatically guaranteed. Contrary to the current operator splitting methods the very high convergence speed of the new RT method does not deteriorate when the grid spatial resolution is increased. With this non-linear multigrid method non-LTE problems discretized on N grid points are solved in O(N) operations. The nested multigrid RT method presented here is, thus, particularly attractive in complicated multilevel transfer problems where small grid-sizes are required. The properties of the method are analyzed both analytically and with illustrative multilevel calculations for Ca II in 1D and 2D schematic model atmospheres.},

abstract = {The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory has provided unique observations of off-limb flare emission. White-light (WL) continuum enhancements were detected in the "continuum" channel of the Fe 6173 A line during the impulsive phase of the observed flares. In this paper we aim to determine which radiation mechanism is responsible for such an enhancement being seen above the limb, at chromospheric heights around or below 1000 km. Using a simple analytical approach, we compare two candidate mechanisms, the hydrogen recombination continuum (Paschen) and the Thomson continuum due to scattering of disk radiation on flare electrons. Both mechanisms depend on the electron density, which is typically enhanced during the impulsive phase of a flare as the result of collisional ionization (both thermal and also non-thermal due to electron beams). We conclude that for electron densities higher than $10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$, the Paschen recombination continuum significantly dominates the Thomson scattering continuum and there is some contribution from the hydrogen free-free emission. This is further supported by detailed radiation-hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations of the flare chromosphere heated by the electron beams. We use the RHD code FLARIX to compute the temporal evolution of the flare heating in a semi-circular loop. The synthesized continuum structure above the limb resembles the off-limb flare structures detected by HMI, namely their height above the limb, as well as the radiation intensity. These results are consistent with recent findings related to hydrogen Balmer continuum enhancements, which were clearly detected in disk flares by the IRIS near-ultraviolet spectrometer.},

We present some of the ideas that have been developed over the past 30 years toward this end. These include the use of very high order spatial operators in the design of the high order fluxes, non-clipping flux limiters, the appropriate choice of constraint variables in the critical flux-limiting step, and the implementation of a “failsafe” flux-limiting strategy.\n \nThis chapter confines itself to the design of FCT algorithms for structured grids, using a finite volume formalism, for this is the area with which the present author is most familiar.

abstract = {A Hilbert space embedding of a distribution-in short, a kernel mean embedding-has recently emerged as a powerful tool for machine learning and statistical inference. The basic idea behind this framework is to map distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in which the whole arsenal of kernel methods can be extended to probability measures. It can be viewed as a generalization of the original "feature map" common to support vector machines (SVMs) and other kernel methods. In addition to the classical applications of kernel methods, the kernel mean embedding has found novel applications in fields ranging from probabilistic modeling to statistical inference, causal discovery, and deep learning. This survey aims to give a comprehensive review of existing work and recent advances in this research area, and to discuss challenging issues and open problems that could potentially lead to new research directions. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the RKHS and positive definite kernels which forms the backbone of this survey, followed by a thorough discussion of the Hilbert space embedding of marginal distributions, theoretical guarantees, and a review of its applications. The embedding of distributions enables us to apply RKHS methods to probability measures which prompts a wide range of applications such as kernel two-sample testing, independent testing, and learning on distributional data. Next, we discuss the Hilbert space embedding for conditional distributions, give theoretical insights, and review some applications. The conditional mean embedding enables us to perform sum, product, and Bayes' rules-which are ubiquitous in graphical model, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning- in a non-parametric way using this new representation of distributions. We then discuss relationships between this framework and other related areas. Lastly, we give some suggestions on future research directions.},

abstract = {Solar flares observed in the 200-400 GHz radio domain may exhibit a slowly varying and time-extended component which follows a short (few minutes) impulsive phase and which lasts for a few tens of minutes to more than one hour. The few examples discussed in the literature indicate that such long-lasting submillimeter emission is most likely thermal bremsstrahlung. We present a detailed analysis of the time-extended phase of the 2003 October 27 (M6.7) flare, combining 1-345 GHz total-flux radio measurements with X-ray, EUV, and H{\alpha} observations. We find that the time-extended radio emission is, as expected, radiated by thermal bremsstrahlung. Up to 230 GHz, it is entirely produced in the corona by hot and cool materials at 7-16 MK and 1-3 MK, respectively. At 345 GHz, there is an additional contribution from chromospheric material at a few 10^4 K. These results, which may also apply to other millimeter-submillimeter radio events, are not consistent with the expectations from standard semi-empirical models of the chromosphere and transition region during flares, which predict observable radio emission from the chromosphere at all frequencies where the corona is transparent.},

abstract = {Context. For most astronomical objects, radiation is the only probe of their physical properties. Therefore, it is important to have the most elaborate theoretical tool to interpret observed spectra or images, thus providing invaluable information to build theoretical models of the physical nature, the structure, and the evolution of the studied objects. Aims. We present IRIS, a new generic three-dimensional (3D) spectral radiative transfer code that generates synthetic spectra, or images. It can be used as a diagnostic tool for comparison with astrophysical observations or laboratory astrophysics experiments. Methods. We have developed a 3D short-characteristic solver that works with a 3D nonuniform Cartesian grid. We have implemented a piecewise cubic, locally monotonic, interpolation technique that dramatically reduces the numerical diffusion effect. The code takes into account the velocity gradient effect resulting in gradual Doppler shifts of photon frequencies and subsequent alterations of spectral line profiles. It can also handle periodic boundary conditions. This first version of the code assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and no scattering. The opacities and source functions are specified by the user. In the near future, the capabilities of IRIS will be extended to allow for non-LTE and scattering modeling. Results. IRIS has been validated through a number of tests. We provide the results for the most relevant ones, in particular a searchlight beam test, a comparison with a 1D plane-parallel model, and a test of the velocity gradient effect. Conclusions. IRIS is a generic code to address a wide variety of astrophysical issues applied to different objects or structures, such as accretion shocks, jets in young stellar objects, stellar atmospheres, exoplanet atmospheres, accretion disks, rotating stellar winds, cosmological structures. It can also be applied to model laboratory astrophysics experiments, such as radiative shocks produced with high power lasers. {\textcopyright} 2013 ESO.},

abstract = {The heating of the solar atmosphere by strongly damped Alfv{\'{e}}n waves that produce heating through plasma-neutral collisions is studied by solving analytically a self-consistent one-dimensional model of the plasma-neutral- electromagnetic system. We compute the vertical profile of the wave spectrum and power by a novel method, which includes the damping effect neglected in previous treatments, and find that the damping depends on the magnetic field strength. The damping is extremely strong for weaker magnetic field and less strong for strong field. Under either condition, the high-frequency portion of the source power spectrum is strongly damped at the lower altitudes, depositing heat there, whereas the lower-frequency perturbations are nearly undamped and can be observed in the corona and above when the field is strong. The chromosphere behaves like a low-pass filter. The magnetic field strength determines the upper cutoff frequency. As a result, the power and spectrum of the waves observed above the corona is weak for regions of weaker background magnetic field and only a fraction of those at the photosphere for regions of strong magnetic field. Contrary to what was supposed in some earlier Alfv{\'{e}}n wave damping models, the spectrum observed above the chromosphere in general does not represent the energy input. We show, using the parameters of a semi-empirical model for quiet-Sun conditions, that this mechanism, without invoking any anomalous processes, can generate sufficient heat to account for the radiative losses in the atmosphere, with most of the heat deposited as required at lower altitudes.

The minimum temperature is located deeper and is higher than in the quiet-sun and active-region models. The results do not agree with the particle-heated theoretical models, and it is suggested that the models of Brown (1973) and Henoux and Nakagawa (1977, 1978) do not include an essential term for heat conduction in their energy balance equations. It is concluded that substantial Ly-alpha radiative heating occurs in the upper chromosphere resulting from the conductive energy flux in the transition zone where the Ly-alpha line cools the gas.},

abstract = {The question of what heats the solar corona remains one of the most important problems in astrophysics. Finding a definitive solution involves a number of challenging steps, beginning with an identification of the energy source and ending with a prediction of observable quantities that can be compared directly with actual observations. Critical intermediate steps include realistic modeling of both the energy release process (the conversion of magnetic stress energy or wave energy into heat) and the response of the plasma to the heating. A variety of difficult issues must be addressed: highly disparate spatial scales, physical connections between the corona and lower atmosphere, complex microphysics, and variability and dynamics. Nearly all of the coronal heating mechanisms that have been proposed produce heating that is impulsive from the perspective of elemental magnetic flux strands. It is this perspective that must be adopted to understand how the plasma responds and radiates. In our opinion, the most promising explanation offered so far is Parker's idea of nanoflares occurring in magnetic fields that become tangled by turbulent convection. Exciting new developments include the identification of the "secondary instability" as the likely mechanism of energy release and the demonstration that impulsive heating in sub-resolution strands can explain certain observed properties of coronal loops that are otherwise very difficult to understand. Whatever the detailed mechanism of energy release, it is clear that some form of magnetic reconnection must be occurring at significant altitudes in the corona (above the magnetic carpet), so that the tangling does not increase indefinitely. This article outlines the key elements of a comprehensive strategy for solving the coronal heating problem and warns of obstacles that must be overcome along the way. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {Current post-processing techniques for the correction of atmospheric seeing in solar observations – such as Speckle interferometry and Phase Diversity methods – have limitations when it comes to their reconstructive capabilities of solar flare observations. This, combined with the sporadic nature of flares meaning observers cannot wait until seeing conditions are optimal before taking measurements, means that many ground-based solar flare observations are marred with bad seeing. To combat this, we propose a method for dedicated flare seeing correction based on training a deep neural network to learn to correct artificial seeing from flare observations taken during good seeing conditions. This model uses transfer learning, a novel technique in solar physics, to help learn these corrections. Transfer learning is when another network already trained on similar data is used to influence the learning of the new network. Once trained, the model has been applied to two flare data sets: one from AR12157 on 2014 September 6 and one from AR12673 on 2017 September 6. The results show good corrections to images with bad seeing with a relative error assigned to the estimate based on the performance of the model. Further discussion takes place of improvements to the robustness of the error on these estimates.},

@article{Trottet2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Solar observations in the infrared domain can bring important clues on the response of the low solar atmosphere to primary energy released during flares. At present, the infrared continuum has been detected at 30 THz (10 $\mu$m) in only a few flares. SOL2012-03-13, which is one of these flares, has been presented and discussed in Kaufmann et al. (Astrophys. J.768, 134, 2013). No firm conclusions were drawn on the origin of the mid-infrared radiation. In this work we present a detailed multi-frequency analysis of the SOL2012-03-13 event, including observations at radio-millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, in hard X-rays (HXR), gamma-rays (GR), H$\alpha$, and white light. The HXR/GR spectral analysis shows that SOL2012-03-13 is a GR line flare and allows estimating the numbers of and energy contents in electrons, protons, and $\alpha$ particles produced during the flare. The energy spectrum of the electrons producing the HXR/GR continuum is consistent with a broken power-law with an energy break at (Formula presented.). We show that the high-energy part ((Formula presented.)) of this distribution is responsible for the high-frequency radio emission ((Formula presented.)) detected during the flare. By comparing the 30 THz emission expected from semi-empirical and time-independent models of the quiet and flare atmospheres, we find that most ((Formula presented.)) of the observed 30 THz radiation can be attributed to thermal free–free emission of an optically thin source. Using the F2 flare atmospheric model (Machado et al. in Astrophys. J.242, 336, 1980), this thin source is found to be at temperatures T (Formula presented.) and is located well above the minimum temperature region. We argue that the chromospheric heating, which results in 80 % of the 30 THz excess radiation, can be due to energy deposition by nonthermal flare-accelerated electrons, protons, and $\alpha$ particles. The remaining 20 % of the 30 THz excess emission is found to be radiated from an optically thick atmospheric layer at T (Formula presented.), below the temperature minimum region, where direct heating by nonthermal particles is insufficient to account for the observed infrared radiation.},

abstract = {We use radiation hydrodynamic simulations to examine two models of solar flare chromospheric heating: Alfv\'en wave dissipation and electron beam collisional losses. Both mechanisms are capable of strong chromospheric heating, and we show that the distinctive atmospheric evolution in the mid-to-upper chromosphere results in Mg II k-line emission that should be observably different between wave-heated and beam-heated simulations. We also present Ca II 8542A profiles which are formed slightly deeper in the chromosphere. The Mg II k-line profiles from our wave-heated simulation are quite different from those from a beam-heated model and are more consistent with IRIS observations. The predicted differences between the Ca II 8542A in the two models are small. We conclude that careful observational and theoretical study of lines formed in the mid-to-upper chromosphere holds genuine promise for distinguishing between competing models for chromospheric heating in flares.},

@article{Hopkins2015,
abstract = {We present two new Lagrangian methods for hydrodynamics, in a systematic comparison with moving-mesh, SPH, and stationary (non-moving) grid methods. The new methods are designed to simultaneously capture advantages of both smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based/adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) schemes. They are based on a kernel discretization of the volume coupled to a high-order matrix gradient estimator and a Riemann solver acting over the volume 'overlap.' We implement and test a parallel, second-order version of the method with self-gravity & cosmological integration, in the code GIZMO: this maintains exact mass, energy and momentum conservation; exhibits superior angular momentum conservation compared to all other methods we study; does not require 'artificial diffusion' terms; and allows the fluid elements to move with the flow so resolution is automatically adaptive. We consider a large suite of test problems, and find that on all problems the new methods appear competitive with moving-mesh schemes, with some advantages (particularly in angular momentum conservation), at the cost of enhanced noise. The new methods have many advantages vs. SPH: proper convergence, good capturing of fluid-mixing instabilities, dramatically reduced 'particle noise' & numerical viscosity, more accurate sub-sonic flow evolution, & sharp shock-capturing. Advantages vs. non-moving meshes include: automatic adaptivity, dramatically reduced advection errors & numerical overmixing, velocity-independent errors, accurate coupling to gravity, good angular momentum conservation and elimination of 'grid alignment' effects. We can, for example, follow hundreds of orbits of gaseous disks, while AMR and SPH methods break down in a few orbits. However, fixed meshes minimize 'grid noise.' These differences are important for a range of astrophysical problems.},

abstract = {We have undertaken a major enhancement of our IDL-based simulation tools developed earlier for modeling microwave and X-ray emission. The object-based architecture provides an interactive graphical user interface that allows the user to import photospheric magnetic field maps and perform magnetic field extrapolations to almost instantly generate 3D magnetic field models, to investigate the magnetic topology of these models by interactively creating magnetic field lines and associated magnetic flux tubes, to populate the flux tubes with user-defined nonuniform thermal plasma and anisotropic, nonuniform, nonthermal electron distributions; to investigate the spatial and spectral properties of radio and X-ray emission calculated from the model, and to compare the model-derived images and spectra with observational data. The application integrates shared-object libraries containing fast gyrosynchrotron emission codes developed in FORTRAN and C++, soft and hard X-ray codes developed in IDL, a FORTRAN-based potential-field extrapolation routine and an IDL-based linear force free field extrapolation routine. The interactive interface allows users to add any user-defined radiation code that adheres to our interface standards, as well as user-defined magnetic field extrapolation routines. Here we use this tool to analyze a simple single-loop flare and use the model to constrain the 3D structure of the magnetic flaring loop and 3D spatial distribution of the fast electrons inside this loop. We iteratively compute multi-frequency microwave and multi-energy X-ray images from realistic magnetic fluxtubes obtained from an extrapolation of a magnetogram taken prior to the flare, and compare them with imaging data obtained by SDO, NoRH, and RHESSI instruments. We use this event to illustrate use of the tool for general interpretation of solar flares to address disparate problems in solar physics.},

abstract = {The forward fitting of solar flare observations with radiation–hydrodynamic simulations is a common technique for learning about energy deposition and atmospheric evolution during these explosive events. A frequent spectral line choice for this process is Ca ii 854.2 nm due to its formation in the chromosphere and substantial variability. It is important to ensure that this line is accurately modelled to obtain the correct interpretation of observations. Here, we investigate the importance of photoionization of Ca ii to Ca iii by the hydrogen Lyman transitions, whilst the Lyman continuum is typically considered in this context in simulations, the associated bound–bound transitions are not. This investigation uses two RADYN flare simulations and reprocesses the radiative transfer using the Lightweaver framework which accounts for the overlapping of all active transitions. The Ca ii 854.2 nm line profiles are found to vary significantly due to photoionization by the Lyman lines, showing notably different shapes and even reversed asymmetries. Finally, we investigate to what extent these effects modify the energy balance of the simulation and the implications on future radiation–hydrodynamic simulations. There is found to be a 10–15 per cent change in detailed optically thick radiative losses from considering these photoionization effects on the calcium lines in the two simulations presented, demonstrating the importance of considering these effects in a self-consistent way.},

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The event was classified as M2.9 in X-rays and 1N in H[alpha]. Solar Submillimeter Telescope observations, in addition to microwave data, give a good spectral coverage between 1.415 and 212{\^{A}} GHz. We combine these data with ultraviolet images, hard and soft X-ray observations, and full-disk magnetograms. Images obtained from Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager data are used to identify the locations of X-ray sources at different energies, and to determine the X-ray spectrum, while ultraviolet images allow us to characterize the coronal flaring region. The magnetic field evolution of the active region is analyzed using Michelson Doppler Imager magnetograms. The burst is detected at all available radio frequencies. X-ray images (between 12{\^{A}} keV and 300{\^{A}} keV) reveal two compact sources. In the 212{\^{A}} GHz data, which are used to estimate the radio-source position, a{\^{A}} single compact source is seen, displaced by 25{\^{a}}[euro]3 from one of the hard X-ray footpoints. We model the radio spectra using two homogeneous sources, and we combine this analysis with that of hard X-rays to understand the dynamics of the accelerated particles. Relativistic particles, observed at radio wavelengths above 50{\^{A}} GHz, have an electron index evolving with the typical soft{\^{a}}[euro]"hard{\^{a}}[euro]"soft behavior.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Solar flare energy manifestations were believed to be the result of the same kind of particle acceleration. It is generally accepted that a population of relativistic electrons accelerated during the impulsive phase of solar flares produces microwaves by synchrotron losses in the solar magnetic field and X-rays by collisions in denser regions of the solar atmosphere. We report the discovery of a new intense solar flare spectral radiation component, peaking somewhere in the shorter submillimeter to far-infrared range, identified during the 2003 November 4 large flare. The new solar submillimeter telescope, designed to extend the frequency range to above 100 GHz, detected this new component with increasing fluxes between 212 and 405 GHz. It appears along with, but is separated from, the well-known gyrosynchrotron emission component seen at microwave frequencies. The novel emission component had three major peaks with time, originated in a compact source whose position remained remarkably steady within 15". Intense subsecond pulses are superposed with excess fluxes also increasing with frequency and amplitude increasing with the pulse repetition rate. The origin of the terahertz emission component during the flare impulsive phase is not known. It might be representative of emission due to electrons with energies considerably larger than the energies assumed to explain emission at microwaves. This component can attain considerably larger intensities in the far-infrared, with a spectrum extending to the white-light emission observed for that flare.},

abstract = {Vital cellular processes, from cell growth to synaptic transmission, rely on membrane-bounded carriers and vesicles to transport molecular cargo to and from specific intracellular compartments throughout the cell. Compartment-specific proteins are required for the final step, membrane fission, which releases the transport carrier from the intracellular compartment. The role of fission proteins, especially at intracellular locations and in non-neuronal cells, while informed by the dynamin-1 paradigm, remains to be resolved. In this study, we introduce a highly sensitive approach for the identification and analysis of membrane fission machinery, called burst analysis spectroscopy (BAS). BAS is a single particle, free-solution approach, well suited for quantitative measurements of membrane dynamics. Here, we use BAS to analyze membrane fission induced by the potent, fission-active ENTH domain of epsin. Using this method, we obtained temperature-dependent, time-resolved measurements of liposome size and concentration changes, even at sub-micromolar concentration of the epsin ENTH domain. We also uncovered, at 37°C, fission activity for the full-length epsin protein, supporting the argument that the membrane-fission activity observed with the ENTH domain represents a native function of the full-length epsin protein.},

abstract = {The heating mechanism at high densities during M-dwarf flares is poorly understood. Spectra of M-dwarf flares in the optical and near-ultraviolet wavelength regimes have revealed three continuum components during the impulsive phase: 1) an energetically dominant blackbody component with a color temperature of T≈104K$T\approx10^{4}\sim\mbox{K}$ in the blue-optical, 2) a smaller amount of Balmer continuum emission in the near-ultraviolet at $\lambda$≤3646$\lambda\le3\,646$ {\AA}, and 3) an apparent pseudo-continuum of blended high-order Balmer lines between $\lambda$=3646$\lambda=3\,646$ {\AA} and $\lambda$≈3900$\lambda\approx3\,900$ {\AA}. These properties are not reproduced by models that employ a typical “solar-type” flare heating level of ≤1011ergcm−2s−1${\le}\,10^{11}\sim\mbox{erg}\,\mbox{cm}^{-2}\,\mbox{s}^{-1}$ in nonthermal electrons, and therefore our understanding of these spectra is limited to a phenomenological three-component interpretation. We present a new 1D radiative-hydrodynamic model of an M-dwarf flare from precipitating nonthermal electrons with a high energy flux of 1013ergcm−2s−1$10^{13}\sim\mbox{erg}\,\mbox{cm}^{-2}\,\mbox{s}^{-1}$. The simulation produces bright near-ultraviolet and optical continuum emission from a dense (n>1015cm−3$n>10^{15}\sim\mbox{cm}^{-3}$), hot (T≈12000–13500K$T \approx12\,000\,\mbox{--}\,13\,500\sim\mbox{K}$) chromospheric condensation. For the first time, the observed color temperature and Balmer jump ratio are produced self-consistently in a radiative-hydrodynamic flare model. We find that a T≈104K$T\approx10^{4}\sim\mbox{K}$ blackbody-like continuum component and a low Balmer jump ratio result from optically thick Balmer (∞→n=2$\infty\rightarrow n=2$) and Paschen recombination (∞→n=3$\infty\rightarrow n=3$) radiation, and thus the properties of the flux spectrum are caused by blue ($\lambda$≈4300$\lambda\approx4\,300$ {\AA}) light escaping over a larger physical depth range than by red ($\lambda$≈6700$\lambda\approx6\,700$ {\AA}) and near-ultraviolet ($\lambda$≈3500$\lambda\approx3\,500$ {\AA}) light. To model the near-ultraviolet pseudo-continuum previously attributed to overlapping Balmer lines, we include the extra Balmer continuum opacity from Landau–Zener transitions that result from merged, high-order energy levels of hydrogen in a dense, partially ionized atmosphere. This reveals a new diagnostic of ambient charge density in the densest regions of the atmosphere that are heated during dMe and solar flares.},

The fine structures (below 500 km) of flares are rarely observed and are accessible to only a few instruments world-wide. Here we present observation of a solar flare using exceptionally high resolution images from the 1.6 m New Solar Telescope (NST) equipped with high order adaptive optics at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). The observation reveals the process of the flare in unprecedented detail, including the flare ribbon propagating across the sunspots, coronal rain (made of condensing plasma) streaming down along the post-flare loops, and the chromosphere's response to the impact of coronal rain, showing fine-scale brightenings at the footpoints of the falling plasma. Taking advantage of the resolving power of the NST, we measure the cross-sectional widths of flare ribbons, post-flare loops and footpoint brighenings, which generally lie in the range of 80-200 km, well below the resolution of most current instruments used for flare studies. Confining the scale of such fine structure provides an essential piece of information in modeling the energy transport mechanism of flares, which is an important issue in solar and plasma physics.},

abstract = {We present a unified computational framework that can be used to describe impulsive flares on the Sun and on dMe stars. The models assume that the flare impulsive phase is caused by a beam of charged particles that is accelerated in the corona and propagates downward depositing energy and momentum along the way. This rapidly heats the lower stellar atmosphere causing it to explosively expand and dramatically brighten. Our models consist of flux tubes that extend from the sub-photosphere into the corona. We simulate how flare-accelerated charged particles propagate down one-dimensional flux tubes and heat the stellar atmosphere using the Fokker–Planck kinetic theory. Detailed radiative transfer is included so that model predictions can be directly compared with observations. The flux of flare-accelerated particles drives return currents which additionally heat the stellar atmosphere. These effects are also included in our models. We examine the impact of the flare-accelerated particle beams on model solar and dMe stellar atmospheres and perform parameter studies varying the injected particle energy spectra. We find the atmospheric response is strongly dependent on the accelerated particle cutoff energy and spectral index.},

abstract = {The Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board the Hinode satellite observed an X3.4 class flare on 2006 December 13. A typical two-ribbon structure was observed, not only in the chromospheric Ca II H line, but also in the G-band and Fe I 6302 {\AA} line. The high-resolution, seeing-free images achieved by SOT revealed, for the first time, sub-arcsec fine structures of the "white light" flare. The G-band flare ribbons on sunspot umbrae showed a sharp leading edge, followed by a diffuse inside, as well as a previously known core-halo structure. The underlying structures, such as umbral dots, penumbral filaments, and granules, were visible in the flare ribbons. Assuming that the sharp leading edge was directly heated by a particle beam and the diffuse parts were heated by radiative back-warming, we estimated the depth of the diffuse flare emission using an intensity profile of the flare ribbon. We found that the depth of the diffuse emission was about 100 km or less from the height of the source of radiative back-warming. The flare ribbons were also visible in the Stokes-V images of Fe I 6302 {\AA}, as a transient polarity reversal. This is probably related to a "magnetic transient" reported in the literature. The intensity increase in Stokes-I images indicates that the Fe I 6302 {\AA} line was significantly deformed by the flare, which may cause such a magnetic transient. {\textcopyright} 2007.

abstract = {The Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) instrument includes a "white light" imaging capability with novel characteristics. Many flares with such white-light emission have been detected, and this paper provides an introductory overview of these data. These observations have 0.5″ pixel size and use the full broad-band response of the CCD sensor; the images are not compromised by ground-based seeing and have excellent pointing stability as well as high time resolution. The spectral response of the TRACE white-light passband extends into the UV, so these data capture, for the first time in images, the main radiative energy of a flare. This initial survey is based on a sample of flares observed at high time resolution for which the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) had complete data coverage, a total of 11 events up to the end of 2004. We characterize these events in terms of source morphology and contrast against the photosphere. We confirm the strong association of the TRACE white-light emissions - which include UV as well as visual wavelengths - with hard X-ray sources observed by RHESSI. The images show fine structure at the TRACE resolution limit, and often show this fine structure to be extended over large areas rather than just in simple footpoint sources. The white-light emission shows strong intermittency both in space and in time and commonly contains features unresolved at the TRACE resolution. We detect white-light continuum emission in flares as weak as GOES C1.6. limited by photon statistics and background solar fluctuations, and support the conclusion of Neidig (1989) that white-light continuum occurs in essentially all flares. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {We present an overview of the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), its instruments, and support facilities. The 4 m aperture DKIST provides the highest-resolution observations of the Sun ever achieved. The large aperture of DKIST combined with state-of-the-art instrumentation provide the sensitivity to measure the vector magnetic field in the chromosphere and in the faint corona, i.e. for the first time with DKIST we will be able to measure and study the most important free-energy source in the outer solar atmosphere – the coronal magnetic field. Over its operational lifetime DKIST will advance our knowledge of fundamental astronomical processes, including highly dynamic solar eruptions that are at the source of space-weather events that impact our technological society. Design and construction of DKIST took over two decades. DKIST implements a fast (f/2), off-axis Gregorian optical design. The maximum available field-of-view is 5 arcmin. A complex thermal-control system was implemented in order to remove at prime focus the majority of the 13 kW collected by the primary mirror and to keep optical surfaces and structures at ambient temperature, thus avoiding self-induced local seeing. A high-order adaptive-optics system with 1600 actuators corrects atmospheric seeing enabling diffraction limited imaging and spectroscopy. Five instruments, four of which are polarimeters, provide powerful diagnostic capability over a broad wavelength range covering the visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectrum. New polarization-calibration strategies were developed to achieve the stringent polarization accuracy requirement of 5×10 −4 . Instruments can be combined and operated simultaneously in order to obtain a maximum of observational information. Observing time on DKIST is allocated through an open, merit-based proposal process. DKIST will be operated primarily in “service mode” and is expected to on average produce 3 PB of raw data per year. A newly developed data center located at the NSO Headquarters in Boulder will initially serve fully calibrated data to the international users community. Higher-level data products, such as physical parameters obtained from inversions of spectro-polarimetric data will be added as resources allow.},

Recent ground-based and space-borne observations of the quiet Sun have revealed that magnetic field accumulates at photospheric heights, via a local dynamo or from small-scale flux emergence events. However, most of this small-scale magnetic field may not expand into the chromosphere due to the entropy drop with height at the photosphere. Here we present a study that uses a high resolution 3D radiative MHD simulation of the solar atmosphere with non-grey and non-LTE radiative transfer and thermal conduction along the magnetic field to reveal that: 1) the net magnetic flux from the simulated quiet photosphere is not sufficient to maintain a chromospheric magnetic field (on average), 2) processes in the lower chromosphere, in the region dominated by magneto-acoustic shocks, are able to convert kinetic energy into magnetic energy, 3) the magnetic energy in the chromosphere increases linearly in time until the r.m.s. of the magnetic field strength saturates at roughly 4 to 30 G (horizontal average) due to conversion from kinetic energy, 4) and that the magnetic features formed in the chromosphere are localized to this region.},

The solar chromosphere, in contrast, remains little understood, although its pivotal role in coronal mass and energy loading makes it a principal research area. Its fine structure defines its overall structure, so that hard-to-observe and hard-to-model small-scale dynamical processes are key to understanding.

abstract = {The evolution of active regions (AR) from their emergence through their long decay process is of fundamental importance in solar physics. Since large-scale flux is generated by the deep-seated dynamo, the observed characteristics of flux emergence and that of the subsequent decay provide vital clues as well as boundary conditions for dynamo models. Throughout their evolution, ARs are centres of magnetic activity, with the level and type of activity phenomena being dependent on the evolutionary stage of the AR. As new flux emerges into a pre-existing magnetic environment, its evolution leads to re-configuration of small-and large-scale magnetic connectivities. The decay process of ARs spreads the once-concentrated magnetic flux over an ever-increasing area. Though most of the flux disappears through small-scale cancellation processes, it is the remnant of large-scale AR fields that is able to reverse the polarity of the poles and build up new polar fields. In this Living Review the emphasis is put on what we have learned from observations, which is put in the context of modelling and simulation efforts when interpreting them. For another, modelling-focused Living Review on the sub-surface evolution and emergence of magnetic flux see Fan (2009). In this first version we focus on the evolution of dominantly bipolar ARs.},

Here we present radiative hydrodynamic simulations of solar flares under different heating models, and calculate the response of this line taking into account non-equilibrium ionization of hydrogen and partial frequency redistribution. We find that in non-thermal heating models, the Ly$\alpha$ line can show a red or blue asymmetry corresponding to the chromospheric evaporation or condensation, respectively. The asymmetry may change from red to blue if the electron beam flux is large enough to produce a significant chromospheric condensation region. In the Ly$\alpha$ intensity lightcurve, there appears a dip when the change of asymmetry occurs. In thermal models, the Ly$\alpha$ line intensity peaks quickly and then falls, and the profile has an overall red asymmetry, which is similar to the profiles from heating by a soft electron beam. The Ly$\alpha$ profile shows a single red peak at the end of thermal heating, and the whole line is formed in a very small height range.},

abstract = {Observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph often reveal significantly broadened and non-reversed profiles of the Mg II h, k and triplet lines at flare ribbons. To understand the formation of these optically thick Mg II lines, we perform plane-parallel radiative hydrodynamics modeling with the RADYN code, and then recalculate the Mg II line profiles from RADYN atmosphere snapshots using the radiative transfer code RH. We find that the current RH code significantly underestimates the Mg II h and k Stark widths. By implementing semiclassical perturbation approximation results of quadratic Stark broadening from the STARK-B database in the RH code, the Stark broadenings are found to be one order of magnitude larger than those calculated from the current RH code. However, the improved Stark widths are still too small, and another factor of 30 has to be multiplied to reproduce the significantly broadened lines and adjacent continuum seen in observations. Nonthermal electrons, magnetic fields, three-dimensional effects, or electron density effects may account for this factor. Without modifying the RADYN atmosphere, we have also reproduced non-reversed Mg II h and k profiles, which appear when the electron beam energy flux is decreasing. These profiles are formed at an electron density of ∼8×10 14 cm −3 and a temperature of ∼1.4×10 4 K, where the source function slightly deviates from the Planck function. Our investigation also demonstrates that at flare ribbons the triplet lines are formed in the upper chromosphere, close to the formation heights of the h and k lines.},

abstract = {Because of the complex physics that governs the formation of chromospheric lines, interpretation of solar chromospheric observations is difficult. The origin and characteristics of many chromospheric features are, because of this, unresolved. We focus here on studying two prominent features: long fibrils and flare ribbons. To model them, we use a 3D MHD simulation of an active region which self-consistently reproduces both of them. We model the H$\alpha$, Mg II k, Ca II K, and Ca II 8542 {\AA} lines using the 3D non-LTE radiative transfer code Multi3D. This simulation reproduces long fibrils that span between the opposite-polarity sunspots and go up to 4 Mm in height. They can be traced in all lines due to density corrugation. Opposite to previous studies, H$\alpha$, Mg II h&k, and Ca II H&K, are formed at similar height in this model. Magnetic field lines are aligned with the H$\alpha$ fibrils, but the latter holds to a lesser extent for the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line. The simulation shows structures in the H$\alpha$ line core that look like flare ribbons. The emission in the ribbons is caused by a dense chromosphere and a transition region at high column mass. The ribbons are visible in all chromospheric lines, but least prominent in Ca II 8542 {\AA} line. In some pixels, broad asymmetric profiles with a single emission peak are produced, similar to the profiles observed in flare ribbons. They are caused by a deep onset of the chromospheric temperature rise and large velocity gradients. The simulation produces long fibrils similar to what is seen in observations. It also produces structures similar to flare ribbons despite the lack of non-thermal electrons in the simulation. The latter suggests that thermal conduction might be a significant agent in transporting flare energy to the chromosphere in addition to non-thermal electrons.},

abstract = {Context: The chromosphere of the Sun is a temporally and spatially very varying medium for which the assumption of ionisation equilibrium is questionable. Aims. Our aim is to determine the dominant processes and timescales for the ionisation equilibrium of calcium under solar chromospheric conditions. Methods. The study is based on numerical simulations with the RADYN code, which combines hydrodynamics with a detailed solution of the radiative transfer equation. The calculations include a detailed non-equilibrium treatment of hydrogen, calcium, and helium. Next to an hour long simulation sequence, additional simulations are produced, for which the stratification is slightly perturbed so that a ionisation relaxation timescale can be determined. The simulations are characterised by upwards propagating shock waves, which cause strong temperature fluctuations and variations of the (non-equilibrium) ionisation degree of calcium. Results. The passage of a hot shock front leads to a strong net ionisation of Ca II, rapidly followed by net recombination. The relaxation timescale of the calcium ionisation state is found to be of the order of a few seconds at the top of the photosphere and 10 to 30 s in the upper chromosphere. At heights around 1 Mm, we find typical values around 60 s and in extreme cases up to ∼150 s. Generally, the timescales are significantly reduced in the wakes of ubiquitous hot shock fronts. The timescales can be reliably determined from a simple analysis of the eigenvalues of the transition rate matrix. The timescales are dominated by the radiative recombination from Ca III into the metastable Ca II energy levels of the 4d 2D term. These transitions depend strongly on the density of free electrons and therefore on the (non-equilibrium) ionisation degree of hydrogen, which is the main electron donor. Conclusions. The ionisation/recombination timescales derived here are too long for the assumption of an instantaneous ionisation equilibrium to be valid and, on the other hand, are not long enough to warrant an assumption of a constant ionisation fraction. Fortunately, the ionisation degree of Ca ii remains small in the height range, where the cores of the H, K, and the infrared triplet lines are formed. We conclude that the difference due to a detailed treatment of Ca ionisation has only negligible impact on the modelling of spectral lines of Ca ii and the plasma properties under the conditions in the quiet solar chromosphere. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2011.},

@article{Woods2006,
abstract = {The solar X-ray radiation varies more than other wavelengths during flares; thus solar X-ray irradiance measurements are relied upon for detecting flare events as well as used to study flare parameters. There is new information about the spectral and temporal variations of flares using solar irradiance measurements from NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and the Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics, and Dynamics (TIMED) missions. For one, the improved measurement precision for the total solar irradiance (TSI) measurements by the SORCE Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) has enabled the first detection of flares in the TSI. These flare observations indicate a total flare energy that is about 105 times more than the X-ray measurements in the 0.1-0.8 nm range. In addition, solar spectral irradiance instruments aboard TIMED and SORCE have observed hundreds of flare events in the 0.1 nm to 190 nm range. These solar ultraviolet measurements show that the ultraviolet irradiance changes during flares account for 50% or more of the flare variations seen in the TSI, with most of the ultraviolet contribution coming from the ultraviolet shortward of 14 nm. The remaining part of the flare energy is assumed to come from the wavelengths longward of 190 nm, typically only needing to be about 100 ppm increase for the largest flares. Another result is that the flare variations in the TSI have a strong limb darkening effect, whereby the flares near the limb indicate variations in the TSI being almost entirely from the ultraviolet shortward of 14 nm.

@article{Osborne2019,
abstract = {During a solar flare, it is believed that reconnection takes place in the corona followed by fast energy transport to the chromosphere. The resulting intense heating strongly disturbs the chromospheric structure, and induces complex radiation hydrodynamic effects. Interpreting the physics of the flaring solar atmosphere is one of the most challenging tasks in solar physics. Here we present a novel deep learning approach, an invertible neural network, to understanding the chromospheric physics of a flaring solar atmosphere via the inversion of observed solar line profiles in H{\alpha} and Ca II {\lambda}8542. Our network is trained using flare simulations from the 1D radiation hydrodynamics code RADYN as the expected atmosphere and line profile. This model is then applied to single pixels from an observation of an M1.1 solar flare taken with SST/CRISP instrument just after the flare onset. The inverted atmospheres obtained from observations provide physical information on the electron number density, temperature and bulk velocity flow of the plasma throughout the solar atmosphere ranging from 0-10 Mm in height. The density and temperature profiles appear consistent with the expected atmospheric response, and the bulk plasma velocity provides the gradients needed to produce the broad spectral lines whilst also predicting the expected chromospheric evaporation from flare heating. We conclude that we have taught our novel algorithm the physics of a solar flare according to RADYN and that this can be confidently used for the analysis of flare data taken in these two wavelengths. This algorithm can also be adapted for a menagerie of inverse problems providing extremely fast ($\sim$10 {\mu}s) inversion samples.},

A part of that is a new fork of the MOMFBD program called REDUX, with several new features that are needed in the new pipeline. The CRISPEX data viewer has been updated to accommodate data cubes stored in this format. The pipeline code, as well as REDUX and CRISPEX are all freely available through git repositories or web download.

@article{DelToroIniesta2016,
abstract = {Since the early 1970s, inversion techniques have become the most useful tool for inferring the magnetic, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of the solar atmosphere. Inversions have been proposed in the literature with a sequential increase in model complexity: astrophysical inferences depend not only on measurements but also on the physics assumed to prevail both on the formation of the spectral line Stokes profiles and on their detection with the instrument. Such an intrinsic model dependence makes it necessary to formulate specific means that include the physics in a properly quantitative way. The core of this physics lies in the radiative transfer equation (RTE), where the properties of the atmosphere are assumed to be known while the unknowns are the four Stokes profiles. The solution of the (differential)RTE is known as the direct or forward problem. From an observational point of view, the problem is rather the opposite: the data are made up of the observed Stokes profiles and the unknowns are the solar physical quantities. Inverting the RTE is therefore mandatory. Indeed, the formal solution of this equation can be considered an integral equation. The solution of such an integral equation is called the inverse problem. Inversion techniques are automated codes aimed at solving the inverse problem. The foundations of inversion techniques are critically revisited with an emphasis on making explicit the many assumptions underlying each of them.},

These new models provide deep insight into complex nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium chromospheric diagnostics and enable physics-based interpretations of observations. ▪ This combination of modeling and observations has led to new insights into the role of shock waves, transverse magnetic waves, magnetic reconnection and flux emergence in the chromospheric energy balance, the formation of spicules, the impact of ion-neutral interactions, and the connectivity between chromosphere and transition region. ▪ During the next few years, the advent of new instrumentation (integral-field-unit spectropolarimetry) and observatories (ALMA, DKIST), coupled with novel inversion codes and expansion of existing numerical models to deal with ever more complex physical processes (including multifluid approaches), is expected to lead to major new insights into the dominant heating processes in the chromosphere and beyond.},

Typically, the results from Skylab indicate that pre-existing closed magnetic loops in the corona are torn open by the force of the disruption. We examine here some of the theoretical consequences to be expected during the extended relaxation phase which must follow such events. This phase is characterized by a gradual reconnection of the outward-distended field lines. In particular, the enhanced coronal expansion which occurs on open field lines just before they reconnect appears adequate to supply the large downward mass fluxes observed in Ha loop prominence systems that form during the post-transient relaxation. In action, this enhanced flow may produce nonrecurrent high speed streams in the solar wind after such events. Calculations of the relaxation phase for representative field geometries and the resulting flow configurations are described.},
