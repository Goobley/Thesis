It is clear that the world around us is multi-dimensional, but until this point we have only considered radiative transfer in one-dimensional plane-parallel atmospheres.

All of the theory of radiative transfer discussed in previous chapters remains valid when applied to higher dimensional systems, with the exception of the description of the formal solver.
This is due to the non-local terms that appear within the MALI description (with diagonal $\Lambda$ operator) being handled by the formal solver, which is responsible for computing the radiation field throughout the plasma from the local parameters and boundary conditions and thus coupling the atmospheric nodes to each other.
Once the radiation field has been computed it is then used as a local parameter in the rest of the iteration.
In fact, if the storage for the atmosphere is ``flattened'' into a one-dimensional form, the code from the plane-parallel case can (and should) be used to implement the iteration scheme.

In this chapter we shall first describe the extension of the \Lw{} framework to two dimensions (with the possibility of further extension), and then describe its application to the simulation a slab of quiet sun being illuminated by an adjacent slab of quiet sun, along with potential implications for future observations at high resolution.

\section{The Formal Solver in Two-Dimensions}\label{Sec:2DFS}

Similarly to the plane-parallel formal solver used in \Lw{}, described in Sec.~\ref{Sec:ShortChar}, we use the short-characteristics method to compute the radiation field throughout the atmosphere.
This approach was first employed in two-dimensions as a pure parabolic treatment by \citet{Kunasz1988} and was developed further by \citet{Auer1994} to produce the aforementioned limited parabolic scheme that avoids possible over- and undershoots.
We assume the following Cartesian basis: the $z$-axis is oriented as in the plane-parallel case, oriented vertically from photosphere to corona, the $x$-axis is perpendicular and co-planar to the $z$-axis (in the plane of the page for the following diagrams), and by the right-hand rule the $y$-axis is oriented into the plane of the page.
In the two-dimensional case it is assumed that the atmospheric parameters are homogenous along the $y$-axis, but vary along the $x$- and $z$-axes.
We assume that the atmosphere has a fixed stratification in $x$ and $z$, and that the atmospheric parameters are known at each intersection of these grids.

The mean intensity at each point will be computed similarly to the plane-parallel case: by integration of the local intensity over a weighted angular quadrature.
The Gauss-Legendre nodes used in the plane-parallel case are poorly suited to anisotropy that occurs in the two- and three-dimensional cases, and so we therefore employ the optimised angular quadratures of \citet{Stepan2020} in \Lw{}.

For each ray prescribed by the angular quadrature the formal solver must perform one sweep through the grid.
The general case, that of an inclined ray travelling through the atmosphere is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Sc2d}.
In the case of this ray the formal solver must sweep first along $x$ and then along $z$.
The difficulties which can arise from this will be discussed in Sec.~\ref{Sec:2dEvalOrder}.
The points $U$ and $D$ refer to them being ``upwind'' and ``downwind'' of the point $O$ for which we are currently computing the intensity.
This can be visualised by looking at the intersections of ray with the grid.
To compute the intensity in the direction of this ray at point $O$ using the short-characteristics formulation we have, as in one-dimension,
\begin{equation}\label{Eq:MiniScDefinition}
   I_O = I_U e^{-(\tau_U - \tau_O)} + \int_{\tau_O}^{\tau_U} S(t) e^{-(t - \tau_O)} \mathop{\dd{}t},
\end{equation}
where these terms have their usual meanings, $I_O$ is the intensity in this direction at $O$, $I_U$ is the intensity in this direction at $U$, and we have dropped the angular and frequency dependencies for clarity.
Thus, to compute the intensity at $O$, the intensity at $U$ must first be known.
As $U$ does not generally lie on a point of our discrete two-dimensional grid, the value of $I_U$ (and other quantities) are not computed directly by the formal solver, and must instead be interpolated from the values of grid points along the line $\alpha\beta$.

Following the short-characteristic method, a functional form must be assigned to the variation of $S$ over the the line segment $[UO]$.
In the simplest case, this can again be a linear functional form, but due to the additional dimension for inhomogeneities in the two-dimensional case, unless the grid is very fine or the atmosphere very slowly varying, this may be a poor choice.
A higher order parametrisation of $S$ is likely to require the values of the source function at both $U$ and $D$, and possibly other points along the ray.
Similarly to the cubic Bézier spline\footnote{A superb graphical introduction to Bézier spline methods and a visualisation of their construction and features is provided in the video by Freya Holmér, \emph{The Beauty of Bézier Curves} available at \url{https://youtu.be/aVwxzDHniEw}.} method used as standard in our plane-parallel code, we once again turn to monotonic Bézier splines for safe, smooth interpolation, minimising the presence of under- and over-shoots.
The cubic method we apply in plane-parallel atmospheres requires four points along $UD$, which becomes less practical in higher dimensions, due to the computational demands of the method.
Instead we choose the quadratic Bézier spline method, BESSER, of \citet{Stepan2013}, which will be briefly summarised here for the scalar case of the RTE.

\subsection{The BESSER method}

The BESSER method \citep{Stepan2013} differs from other monotonic Bézier spline methods by ensuring the continuity of the first derivative of the interpolant at $O$.
Due to the large differences in optical depth between adjacent regions (e.g. $\tau_{UO}$ and $\tau_{OD}$) that are likely to occur in multi-dimensional cases with irregular grids, this method is designed so as to guarantee that if the values over $[UOD]$ are monotonic then the spline interpolant will remain monotonic.

The spline interpolant over the $[UO]$ interval is described by
\begin{equation}
    f(a) = (1-a)^2f_U + 2a(1-a)c_U + a^2f_O,\hspace{3em}a\in[0,1],
\end{equation}

where $f_U$ and $f_O$ are the values of $f$ at points $U$ and $O$ respectively, $c_U$ is the functional value of the spline's control point, and $a$ is the normalised coordinate for the distance along $[UO]$.
The control points are points half way along an interval, defining the tangent to the spline at each end of the range i.e. $c_U O$ defines the tangent to the spline at $O$ and $U c_U$ defines the tangent to the spline at $U$.
If we denote the coordinates of our points along the ray $s_U$, $s_O$, and $s_D$ then we have $a = (s - s_U) / h_U$, where $h_U = s_U - s_O$ \added{and $s\in [s_U, s_O]$}.
An equivalent interpolation can be defined over the $[OD]$ segment.
The monotonicity (for monotonic $f_U$, $f_O$, $f_D$) and continuous first derivative of the interpolating functions at $O$ is ensured by following this procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify the monotonicity of $f_U$, $f_O$, $f_D$, and if $f_O$ is a local extremum then the control points $c_U$ and $c_D$ are set to $f_O$, giving a derivative of zero at $O$. As this is is the only possible solution for this case, the process stops here.

    \item Compute an estimate of the derivative at $O$, by using the derivative of the standard parabolic interpolation of $UOD$.

    \item Use this derivative to compute the initial values at the control points, by direct projection of the first derivative to their coordinates (as this defines a tangent to function at $O$).

    \item Check $c_U \in [f_U, f_O]$. If not, set $c_U$ to $f_U$ to correct for any new extremum and halt the process, as $c_D$ is not needed for the integration of the source function.

    \item Check $c_D \in [f_O, f_D]$. If not, set $c_D$ to $f_D$, and use this to compute a new value for the derivative at $O$, and follow the projection of this tangent to determine $c_U$ (due to the enforced continuity of the derivative at $O$).
\end{enumerate}
This process is described in more detail in \citet{Stepan2013}, but this covers the most important elements of the process.

Similarly to the plane-parallel case, we will solve the RTE in optical depth, due to its increased stability.
This interpolation method can be used to compute the optical depths $\tau_{UO}$ and $\tau_{OD}$ along these segments by
\begin{align}
    \tau_{UO} &= \frac{1}{3}(\chi_U + \chi_O + \chi_{c_U}) (s_O - s_U),\\
    \tau_{OD} &= \frac{1}{2}(\chi_O + \chi_D) (s_D - s_O).
\end{align}
Note that a linear approximation was used for $\tau_{OD}$, as the previous process does not guarantee the calculation of $c_D$.
This could be modified to also use the quadratic spline method, which may be more robust, however the value of $\tau_{OD}$ rarely affects the final solution dramatically.

This method can now be applied to the source function but parametrised along $\tau$ \added{rather than geometric distance along the ray} $s$.
The BESSER quadratic spline method is then used to compute the value of the source function control point $S_{c_U}$.
The integral in \eqref{Eq:MiniScDefinition} can now be evaluated, by using the prescribed quadratic spline variation of $S$ over the interval $[\tau_{U}, \tau_{O}]$.
Working through the maths we arrive at
\begin{equation}
    I_D = I_Ue^{-\tau_{UO}} + \omega_U S_U + \omega_O S_O + \omega_{c_U} S_{c_U},
\end{equation}
where,
{
\def\edt{e^{-\tau_{UO}}}
\def\tsq{\tau_{UO}^2}
\begin{align}
    \omega_U &= \frac{2 - (\tsq + 2\tau_{UO} + 2)\edt}{\tsq},\\
    \omega_O &= 2\frac{\tau_{UO} - 2 + \edt (\tau_{UO} + 2)}{\tsq},\\
    \omega_{c_U} &= 1 - 2 \frac{\edt + \tau_{UO} - 1}{\tsq}.
\end{align}
}

For small values of $\tau_{UO}$ the numerical precision of \replaced{these coefficients}{ the exponential function} becomes unreliable (in floating point arithmetic), so for this reason these are replaced with Taylor expansions for $\tau_{UO}\lesssim 0.1$.

An expression for the $\Lambda^*$ operator can then be devised equivalently to the process used previously for the plane-parallel case.
The source function is locally set to unity, and zero elsewhere.
This implies that $c_U$ is also set to 1.
Thus the local contribution to the radiation field is given by
\begin{equation}
    \Lambda^*(\nu, \vec{d}) = \omega_{c_U} + \omega_O,
\end{equation}
and remains related to $\Psi^*$ by the local opacity.

The equivalent integration and $\Lambda$ operator coefficients for a linear short-characteristics approach can be computed similarly and are analogous to those computed in the one-dimensional case.

\subsection{Evaluation Order and Boundary Conditions}\label{Sec:2dEvalOrder}

Looking more closely at the order in which the formal solver needs to sweep the grid, we can see that the point $O$ for the ray discussed in the previous section (and shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Sc2d}) would be the 10th node to be solved, and this ordering is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DSweep}.
Most of the nodes on this figure are solved equivalently to this one, with all necessary quantities known at evaluation time provided the sweep order is preserved, but there are several question marks which require explanation.

\begin{figure}

\subimport{03TwoDRT/}{SweepOrder}
\caption{Diagram of sweep order for two-dimensional short-characteristics formal solver.}
\label{Fig:2DSweep}
\end{figure}

The {\color{TolCyan} cyan} question marks along the $x$ axis all require values that must be computed from the boundary conditions.
The upper and lower boundary conditions in $z$ are typically taken to be described by a defined in-going radiation field (possibly zero or based on a black body).
The upper and lower boundaries in $x$ can be described by fixed boundary conditions, but it is also common to describe these with periodic boundary conditions where the ray wraps from one side of the grid to the other.
The {\color{TolTeal} teal} question marks along the upper $x$ boundary can then be interpreted in multiple ways: in the case of periodic boundary conditions they can be prolonged along the {\color{TolTeal} teal} arrows, and used in the same way as the previously described case.
If fixed boundary conditions are used then the intensity at these points must be computed by a linear formal solver indicated by the black arrows ending at the nodes labelled 4 and 8.

Finally, the region around the {\color{TolOrange} orange} question mark, the tail end of the arrow passing through node 11, requires some additional explanation.
In the configuration shown here, the arrow can stop at its intersection with the vertical line on which nodes 6 and 10 lie as the intensity information has been computed at both of these.
If an equivalent situation occurs at a periodic $x$ boundary, then a long-characteristics approach will need to be applied to this ray.
This implies that the ray will need to be prolonged back to the previous intersection with a horizontal grid line, where the necessary intensity values can be interpolated, as is shown on this figure.
There are multiple options for treating the integration over the segment between this upwind point and the node.
Whilst it is possible to take this segment as a singular integration term, very inclined rays may cross multiple vertical grid lines and regions with dramatically varying parameters.
For this reason it is common to sub-step along this ray, performing an accumulated short-characteristics integration along each subinterval.

Another problem that may arise, closely related to choosing the correct upwind point, is that of velocity shifts in the medium.
\citet{VanNoort2002} discussed the possibility of the opacity over an integration integral being underestimated due to differing Doppler shifts at each end of the segment affecting the local opacity by a large margin (say from the core to the wing of the line).
As commented by \citet{Ibgui2013}, it is also possible for this effect to overestimate the opacity along this segment, in a similar manner.
The most common solution to this, proposed by \citet{VanNoort2002}, and explained in detail in \citet{Ibgui2013} is to subgrid along the ray.
The ray is then divided into subintervals along which the velocity may only change by a small (implementation defined) amount relative to the thermal velocity.
This approach can be very expensive when large Doppler shifts are present, due to the work involved in computing these segments, interpolating the necessary parameters to each start/end point (this will now require interpolation on both axes, rather than simply one as in the basic case discussed thus far), and the extra numerical integration steps.
This subgridding technique is not currently supported in \Lw{} but the code was designed with this method in mind, and a sensible location has been left for its implementation.

\subsection{Implementation Details}

The restrictive ordering of the formal solver sweep discussed in the previous section imposes constraints on the parallelisation of this algorithm.
% In the case of a single-threaded program, it is sufficient to obey this order, however, when distributing work across threads or multiple computing nodes it is essential that the necessary information be present to avoid computation stalls, or the use of uninitialised data.
There is an in-depth discussion of an advanced spatial and frequency parallelisation algorithm for multi-dimensional radiative transfer in \citet{Stepan2013}, however in \Lw{} we assume that the entire simulation domain can be held in memory and the formal solver is parallelised in frequency, equivalently to the plane-parallel case.

The data structures for storing the atmospheric and population information in \Lw{} were updated to support two-dimensional atmospheres, storing the data contiguously so as to be able to reuse the core iteration machinery from the plane-parallel case (as inspired by the RH code).
Two-dimensional formal solvers can be loaded from external libraries via the same interface as used for their one-dimensional counterparts, and through these interfaces we ensure the modularity of \Lw{}.
An equivalent interface is also defined for the interpolation function to be used in two-dimensions, giving flexibility in the interpolation order and any form of limiting used (which may need to be adapted to specific grids).
\Lw{} provides default implementations of the two-dimensional linear and BESSER short-characteristics formal solvers, along with linear and BESSER interpolation schemes for the necessary parameters.
The framework defaults to the BESSER formal solver with linear interpolation for the parameters.

For efficiency, the calculation of the ray-grid intersections is performed in a separate pre-pass to the formal solution, as this information can be reused for each formal solution using the same angular quadrature.
Whilst it is possible to compute the necessary parameter interpolation weights at this stage, we choose not to do this, as it would render the interpolation interface either more limited, or substantially more complex, due to the need to utilise different numbers of interpolation weights for different schemes.
We instead opt to store fractional indices which can be used in conjunction with the grid information in any interpolation procedure.
Using 64-bit arithmetic these are a concise and robust method for storing these locations.
By design, the intersection calculation is only performed for one upwind and downwind point
(excluding long characteristics that cross grid boundaries), as we consider the second order method to be a practical trade-off in terms of computational cost against accuracy.
This could easily be updated in the future, and we acknowledge that this is a limitation in terms of the two-dimensional formal solvers that can be loaded via the external interface.

It is necessary to validate both the two-dimensional formal solver and its integration into the \Lw{} framework.
Here, we present a basic validation case, a horizontally homogenous FALC atmosphere, using five points in $x$, spaced \SI{5}{\kilo\metre} apart.
The boundary conditions in $x$ are periodic, thermalised at the photosphere, and no radiation is incoming at the top of the atmosphere.
The standard configuration of \Lw{} in two-dimensions is used, i.e. BESSER formal solver and linear interpolation.
The 11th order angular quadrature with 6 rays per octant \citep{Stepan2020} is used when solving for the level populations.

In Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DValidation} we show the comparison of a \CaLine{} computed using this two-dimensional method against the same model atom and atmosphere in a plane-parallel configuration.
Both of these are iterated until the maximum relative change in the \Caii{} populations is less than $10^{-4}$.
The outgoing radiation shown in the upper panel of this figure was synthesised using rays in the $x-z$ plane with $\mu_z = 0.9$.
Visually, the dashed lines, showing the solution from different $x$ locations using the two-dimensional formal solver overlie each other perfectly, showing that the output is homogenous along the $x$ axis, as is to be expected from this horizontally homogenous atmosphere with periodic boundary conditions.
There is a slight visible offset between the solutions generated from the plane-parallel and two-dimensional simulations, and the relative difference between these is shown in the lower panel of this figure.
We see that the relative difference is greatest in the line core, peaking at around 1.5\%.
Overall, this is very good agreement considering the different underlying methods used in the formal solvers.

In Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DErrChange} we show how the difference between the plane-parallel and two-dimensional models changes as the $L^\infty$ norm of the relative population change decreases (i.e. as we approach convergence).
Further iterations beyond a maximum relative population change of $10^{-3}$ do not substantially improve the agreement between the two methods.
Thus, the situation shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DValidation} is sufficiently converged to compare the final solutions of the two methods.

We find that the two-dimensional formal solver performs well, both in terms of accuracy and computational performance. For the example presented here the plane-parallel solution takes \py[2DValidation]|(r'\SI{{{:.3f}}}{{\second}}'.format(time1d))| and the two-dimensional solution takes \py[2DValidation]|(r'\SI{{{:.3f}}}{{\second}}'.format(time2d))| after \py[2DValidation]|Niter1d| and \py[2DValidation]|Niter2d| iterations respectively (this timing includes configuring the additional contexts and the formal solutions used for the convergence analysis shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DErrChange}).
Both of these simulations were run with 16 threads on \emph{tomahna}.

Similar validation tests have been run for fixed boundary conditions and Doppler shifted atmospheres, all of which yielded extremely satisfactory results.
These are shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DValidationVlosFixedX} and utilise the same configuration other than the parameters discussed below.
The left-hand column shows the effects of a vertical velocity field on a simulation with periodic boundary conditions.
This velocity field is uniform in $x$ and defined by the additive inverse of a single period sine wave spanning the entire FALC atmosphere, with the first and last three points set to \SI{0}{\kilo\metre\per\second}.
The amplitude of this wave is set to \SI{20}{\kilo\metre\per\second}.
As such, it represents a simpler version of the plane-parallel test presented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:LwValidationSillyVel}.
The lower row of this column shows that there is once again good agreement between the plane-parallel and two-dimensional models, with differences peaking around 5\% in the line core, but the line shape being accurately reproduced.
This difference could likely be reduced by the use of the previously discussed subgridding technique, but as the simulations that are presented later in this chapter do not use velocity fields within the 2D slab, this work was not undertaken.

In the right-hand column a model with fixed $x$ boundary conditions is presented.
This model also applies an equivalent velocity field, albeit with a smaller \SI{5}{\kilo\metre\per\second} amplitude.
The boundary conditions are computed from the associated one-dimensional simulation; the radiation along each ray of the two-dimensional quadrature needed for the boundary condition at each depth used in the two-dimensional simulation is synthesised from the plane-parallel simulation for both boundary conditions along the $x$ axis.
The radiation presented here is synthesised along a ray with $\mu_z=0.99999$ (\SI{0.25}{\degree}) so that the ray through central $x$ cell at the top of the model does not intersect directly with either of these boundary conditions (as this would simply be sampling the plane-parallel simulation), whilst still testing the two-dimensional nature of the formal solver.
The agreement here is once again very good, with the error peaking around 1.5\%.

The coupling between the two-dimensional and plane-parallel models utilised here is facilitated by the design of the \Lw{} framework, and will be leveraged extensively in the following sections.
A \Lw{} model describing a plane-parallel boundary condition can be updated and synthesise its output dynamically in response to the rays requested from the two-dimensional model, without the need to precompute these values and go through a multi-step saving and loading process that is prone to error when simulation parameters change.
This can be especially difficult in cases where the incoming radiation field from a fixed boundary condition is allowed to be anisotropic, requiring agreement between the rays in both models.
The boundary condition radiation for the almost vertical rays used in the right-hand column is computed automatically due to the design of the class that describes the boundary condition, and the coupling allowed by the framework, which allows easy manipulation and coupling of multiple radiative transfer contexts within the same program.

\section{2D Simulation Configuration}

Flares produce huge changes in the radiation field, in both lines and continua.
They are typically modelled in a plane-parallel context and we analyse the radiation leaving the top of this plane-parallel atmosphere.
In reality, the flaring kernels that we are simulating with these RHD models are likely small; on the scale of 10s to 100s of \si{\kilo\metre} in diameter \citep{Jing2016} and represent an estimate of the conditions in the core of a heated flux-tube.
As the resolution of solar telescopes increases, so does their ability to resolve spatial effects tangential to the solar surface (henceforth horizontal).
The lack of horizontal atmospheric homogeneity, that is not accounted for in these models, may produce complex intensity structures resolvable with these new telescopes as the huge outgoing flux of radiation from the flare core impinges on and interacts with neighbouring plasma.
These effects include the possible `core-halo' pattern reported around flare kernels in ground-based line and continuum imaging \citep{Neidig1993,Xu2006}, TRACE white light observations \citep{Hudson2006}, and Hinode/Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) G-band and Fe\,\textsc{i} \SI{630.2}{\nano\m} observations \citep{Isobe2007}.
The proposed explanation for these halos is typically radiative backwarming from the flare's radiation (previously investigated in-depth using Mg\,\textsc{i} lines by \citet{Metcalf1990}).
In the following we shall focus primarily on NLTE radiative effects affecting plasma neighbouring a flare, but leave the inclusion of temperature variations due to absorption of radiation to a future study.

It is reasonable to suggest that the plasma neighbouring the flare is substantially cooler, both due to the lack of direct heating, and the low strength of cross-field conduction relative to that along the field \citep{Spitzer1953}, however photons are not affected by these limitations.
Thus, we will investigate the effects of illumination from a neighbouring plane-parallel flare model on a two-dimensional slab of plasma representing the quiet atmosphere, with a time-dependent radiative treatment of both of these.
This model can then serve as a ``first-order'' approximate investigation of the effects of flare radiation on the slab, as well as the depth of radiation penetration, effects on the atomic populations, and observable signatures.

Modelling undertaken by \citet{Leenaarts2012a} suggests that a three-dimensional treatment of \Ha{} in quiet Sun models yields very different synthetic line profiles than a 1.5D column-by-column plane-parallel treatment.
\citet{Bjorgen2019} found that these differences were less significant for the bright structure of an active region \citep[based on the simulations of][]{Cheung2019}, but definition appears to be lost in regions adjacent to this structure when a 1.5D treatment is applied.
It is precisely the effects of a bright region on the neighbouring atmosphere that we wish to investigate, and a simple two-dimensional model should reveal the importance and possible time-dependence of reactions to this radiation.

\begin{figure}[tbp]

\subimport{03TwoDRT/}{SimConfig}
\caption{Configuration of the two-dimensional simulation showing the flaring boundary condition.}
\label{Fig:2DSimConfig}
\end{figure}

Our simulation is set up as shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DSimConfig}: the primary simulation domain is a \SI{2}{\mega\metre} wide slab of plasma initially set to the quiet sun atmosphere used for the RADYN simulation.
On one side of this slab we place the RADYN simulation, and compute the intensity along each ray of the angular quadrature used for the 2D slab, at each depth in the simulation.
The other $x$ boundary is treated equivalently, but using the fixed initial quiet sun atmosphere from the RADYN simulation and the 2D slab.
\added{The width of this domain was chosen by a manual iterative process ensuring that the line profiles emerging from the slab close to the quiet Sun boundary naturally and smoothly return to close to the quiet Sun values, otherwise this fixed boundary will be spuriously sinking large quantities of energy.}

Similarly to the process described in the previous chapter a time-dependent simulation is run, again reprocessing the thermodynamic atmospheric properties using RADYN's internal timestep.
The separate components of this model share a $z$ stratification based on a combination of RADYN's grids used for both the initial quiet sun atmosphere and the current timestep.
This method ensures that 450 points are spaced across the entire altitude range of the atmosphere and provide sufficient resolution for the transition region of both the quiet sun model \emph{and} that of the flare model.
The populations \added{determined by \Lw{}} are interpolated between the $z$ grids from one timestep to the next, and locally scaled to follow the mass density (this is typically a small adjustment, but without it errors can grow as points move through the transition region).
The electron density in the flare model is loaded from the RADYN output, and charge is conserved in the 2D slab using the secondary Newton-Raphson iteration procedure discussed in Sec.~\ref{Sec:ChargeCons}.
The 6 rays per octant of the unit sphere quadrature of \citet{Stepan2020} was chosen, as the plasma in the 2D slab is static and these rays capture enough detail to describe the radiation field leaving the plane parallel model (where the radiative transfer model natively uses 5 Gauss-Legendre rays per quadrant of the unit disc).
In addition to the 450 points in $z$, we use 41 linearly spaced points in $x$ to discretise the two-dimensional atmosphere.
As these points span \SI{2}{\mega\metre} each point is spaced \SI{50}{\kilo\metre} apart.
The use of this grid is justified in Sec.~\ref{Sec:HorizontalResolution}.
Due to the very fine $z$ spacing that often occurs due to the strong gradients in the transition region, many of the 2D cells have an aspect ratio very far from square, which can pose convergence difficulties if insufficient angular resolution is used .
Unlike the model in the previous chapter, we do not consider advection here: the plasma in the two-dimensional slab is static, and the effect of advection on the flaring boundary condition is small.
This also has the effect of allowing more flexibility in the $z$ stratification, as a grid that is stable for radiative transfer may not be so for advection.

The left-most column of the 2D slab requires special treatment due to the nature of fixed boundary conditions in radiative transfer simulations.
The incoming radiation from the flare model is specified for each ray and depth in the first column of the atmosphere.
As the intensity is specified for all incoming (rightgoing) rays here, it cannot be calculated taking into account the local parameters, meanwhile the outgoing (leftgoing) rays \emph{do} take into account the local parameters, and then inform the local operator acting on these populations.
Thus, if this column has its thermodynamic properties fixed to those of the initial quiet sun model, it behaves as if it is only receiving radiation from the right, whilst only being affected by the flare in a ``second-hand'' sense.
This leads to a dark first column in the two-dimensional synthesis.
To minimise these effects we copy the flare atmosphere and populations into this first column, and hold these fixed over each timestep.
These populations are then consistent with the adjacent plane-parallel atmosphere and the radiation emerging from it which is used as a fixed boundary condition.
There should not be any need to perform the same process at the quiet sun boundary, as it is placed \SI{2}{\mega\metre} away and should change very little over the course of the simulation, remaining consistent on both sides of the boundary.

\caption[Configuration of two-dimensional simulation to produce radiation that would be observed by a slit spectrograph looking across the model flare.]{Using the single simulation shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DSimConfig} to investigate the radiation observed by a slit spectrograph looking across the flaring region. The radiation emitted along the {\color{TolBlue}blue} arrow from the reflected atmosphere is the same as that from the {\color{TolMagenta}magenta} arrow in the simulated atmosphere. The angles of the rays shown in this diagram are exaggerated relative to those used in the results presented later, to better illustrate the configuration.}
\label{Fig:2DSimFlipped}
\end{figure}

This configuration produces the outgoing intensity at 12 different angles from each of the 41 cells in $x$.
\added{These rays are symmetric in the $z$-axis, so we} can use the symmetric definition of these to synthesise the radiation observed by a theoretical slit spectrograph viewing the sun from a particular inclination with the flare in the centre of the slit.
This is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DSimFlipped} for an observation inclined as shown we are observing the radiation along the blue arrows.
\replaced{Reflecting the entire simulation in the $z$-axis, the intensity observed along the blue ray from the reflected atmosphere is the same as the radiation along the magenta ray produced in the original simulation configuration shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DSimConfig}.
Using the information produced by the original simulation configuration we can therefore produce this view of both sides of the flare.}{ For the reflected atmosphere, the blue arrow shown is equivalent to the magenta arrow from the simulated atmosphere.}

\added{
In the following results, we consider that the flaring boundary is at $x=0$ and will be presented as infinitesimally narrow, with the simulated atmosphere in positive $x$, and its reflection in negative $x$.
To better describe the atmosphere we will split it into regions based on $x$-coordinate as follows: $A := (0, 0.5]$ \si{\mega\metre}, $B := (0.5, 1]$ \si{\mega\metre}, $C := (1, 2]$ \si{\mega\metre}.
We will use minuscules (lower-case) of these designations to denote the reflections of their associated regions in the $z$-axis (i.e. in negative $x$).
}

We will focus primarily on these inclined observations as flares are extremely unlikely to occur at exactly disc centre and the effects of inclination are therefore important.
Even a slight inclination can have a large effect, and in the following we will focus primarily on the most vertical ray present in our quadrature, with an angle of approximately \SI{18}{\degree} ($\mu_z\approx0.95$) to the surface normal.
Only $\sim$1/25 of the visible solar disc has a viewing angle smaller than this, so inclination effects will be at least this significant for the majority of observed flares.
The two-dimensional model is assumed to be homogenous along $y$, and the rays of the angular quadrature used for integration have non-zero $y$ components to correctly sample the unit sphere.
The most vertical ray has an inclination from the surface normal of \SI{18}{\degree} and an azimuth from the $x$-axis of \SI{83}{\degree}, meaning its projected inclination in the non-homogeneous $x-z$ plane is \SI{2.24}{\degree}.

In this simulation we use the same model atoms as the previous chapter, with both hydrogen and calcium being set as active species.
This simulation is carried out for two different flare models illuminating the 2D slab: F9 and F10 models with identical heating parameters to those of Chapter~\ref{Chap:TimeDepRt} including the Lyman line photoionisation effects, but with RADYN's in-built coronal irradiation enabled.
We will now show the results of these simulations, looking at both the observable effects and the population changes internal to the slab, focusing on the \Ha{} and \CaLine{} spectral lines, before comparing these to observations taken with the CRISP instrument on the SST.
To justify the importance of the time-dependent treatment, we will also compare these results against statistical equilibrium solutions computed at several timesteps.


\section{Simulation Results}\label{Sec:2dSimResults}

Due to the additional complexity of the two-dimensional simulation these models are substantially more computationally intensive than the plane-parallel models of the previous chapter, both due to the larger number of points at which the RTE is to be solved as well as the increased angular samples and interpolations needed at each point.
The F9 simulation, consisting of 1793 internal timesteps takes $\sim$2,300 CPU hours, and the F10 model, with 5996 timesteps takes $\sim$8,000 CPU hours on \emph{hercules}.
The tool employed for these simulations is derived from the code described in Chap.~\ref{Chap:TimeDepRt}, and is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Goobley/MsLightweaver2d}}, with archival on Zenodo \citep{MsLw2dThesisRelease}.

Figs.~\ref{Fig:2DHaF9}--\ref{Fig:2DCaF10} show the \Ha{} and \CaLine{} spectral lines in the F9 and F10 simulations respectively.
The left-hand column shows the intensity enhancement in three different wavelengths as a function of space and time, configured as described in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DSimFlipped} with the reflected side shown in negative $x$.
The flare model is presumed to have an infinitesimal width (in $x$) indicated by the horizontal red line.
These three wavelengths sample the line core and secondary features on either side of the line and are indicated by the vertical lines in the left-hand panel, with the line core indicated in blue and the two secondary wavelengths in dashed orange.
This left-hand panel also shows the emergent intensity in this line at $x=\SI{500}{\kilo\metre}$ from the flare at different times throughout the simulation for the most vertical emergent ray from the simulation.
Blue and orange lines are also plotted on the left-hand panel and indicate the distance at which an enhancement of 40\% and 10\% (respectively) over the quiet boundary are observed for this wavelength and time in the simulation.
The different thresholds are used for the positive and negative $x$ regions respectively as the scale of the enhancements vary significantly between these, with the effect in the negative $x$ region being notably smaller.

\py[2DRT]|ch2DRT.get_figure('2DCaF9')|

\py[2DRT]|ch2DRT.get_figure('2DHaF10')|

It is clear from these figures that in all cases the enhancement in the line core is significantly larger in all of value, extent (dimension in $x$), and duration than the wing feature enhancements, with both the positive and negative $x$ enhancements remaining over \SI{0.5}{\mega\metre} from the flare for the entire duration.
The enhancements in the wing features are much smaller in extent and more transient, especially for \Ha{}, where the blue wing feature near the flaring boundary enters a reduction relative to the quiet boundary value soon after heating ends in the flare model ($t=\SI{10}{\second}$).
In \CaLine{} both the blue and red wing features in positive $x$ present a similar extent, but the red wing feature persists for the entire simulation whereas the blue feature vanishes around $t=\SI{30}{\second}$.
There are interesting differences in the negative $x$ enhancements for \CaLine{} between the F9 and F10 models.
In the former there is an enhancement only during the flare heating period, whereas in the latter there is no significant enhancement until after the heating has ended, which then persists for the remainder of the simulation.

The \Ha{} line profile in the F9 simulation (Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DHaF9}) synthesised at $x=\SI{500}{\kilo\metre}$ shows that over the course of the simulation the line core intensity increases, but does not rise above the continuum value, and two secondary features form in the red and blue wings during the flare heating.
These decay rapidly after heating ends, dropping to below the initial quiet value at our blue wing sampling.
The \CaLine{} computed in this same simulation (Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DCaF9}) emits strongly as a doubly-peaked line with a slight asymmetry in favour the red wing and remains so for the majority of the simulation, decaying slowly over time, with the line core decaying more rapidly than the secondary peaks (the peaks of the line profile in this centrally-reversed state), leading to an increasingly deep central reversal.

The effects are similar, but much larger in the F10 simulation.
The \Ha{} line (Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DHaF10}) is greatly enhanced presenting a doubly-peaked shape with a deep central reversal during heating.
This line is notably asymmetric in favour of the red wing throughout the simulation.
After the flare heating ends, the red secondary peak remains enhanced and decays slowly whereas the blue wing rapidly drops below the initial quiet value.
The \CaLine{} line (Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DCaF10}) is a more dramatically enhanced version of the one considered previously for the F9 simulation although its asymmetry flips in favour of the blue wing for the $t=\SI{12}{\second}$ line profile.

We note that for both spectral lines the far wings and continuum ($|\Delta\lambda| \geq \SI{0.1}{\nano\metre}$ for \Ha{} and $|\Delta\lambda| \geq \SI{0.04}{\nano\metre}$ for \CaLine{}) have very small or no variations throughout both simulations.
This will be discussed later, when the effects on the populations are investigated.

To better interpret these simulations we can also look at what our theoretical slit spectrograph described in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2DSimFlipped} would observe at different times in the simulation.

The emergent spectra from the F9 simulation are shown for \Ha{} and \CaLine{} in Figs.~\ref{Fig:HaFull2dPlot} and \ref{Fig:CaFull2dPlot} respectively.
The intensity scale is constant for all timesteps for each line.
As expected from the previous imaging results, significant variations in the line profiles are observed 0.5--\SI{1}{\mega\metre} from the flare location.
Once again, there is a large difference between the positive and negative $x$ regions, with much greater variations observed in the former.
This is likely due to rays passing through the positive $x$ region encountering more scattered light from the flare and directly intersecting the flaring atmosphere.
There is some enhancement in the negative $x$ region, presenting as a narrowing of the line core in \Ha{} and enhancement of the core of \CaLine{}, but it is much less significant than that present in the positive $x$ region.
Despite the horizontal uniformity of plasma properties in this atmosphere, there is substantial variation in the observed radiation.
\deleted{To better discuss these effects in detail we will split the atmosphere into regions based on $x$-coordinate as follows: $A := (0, 0.5]$ \si{\mega\metre}, $B := (0.5, 1]$ \si{\mega\metre}, $C := (1, 2]$ \si{\mega\metre}.
We will use minuscules ($a$, $b$, $c$) of these designations to denote the reflections of their associated regions in the $x$-axis.}

Starting with the \Ha{} line profiles shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:HaFull2dPlot}, during heating ($t=\SI{5}{\second}$) we see a line profile in region $A$ with a broadened core in absorption (dark in the figure) and enhanced secondary peaks in both the red and blue around $|\Delta\lambda|=\SI{0.06}{\nano\metre}$.
In $B$, the line core is enhanced relative to both $A$ and its quiet value with the secondary peaks in the wings around decaying rapidly, producing a shallower absorption profile, before a smooth return to the quiet sun line profile over $C$.
In the negative $x$ region the line is less deep near the flare, decaying back to pre-flare levels over the \SI{2}{\mega\metre} extent.
The situation is similar at the end of the heating ($t=\SI{10}{\second}$), but here the core is more significantly enhanced in region $A$ before deepening but remaining well above the quiet value over $B$ and smoothly transitioning back to its quiet sun form in region $C$.
A slight asymmetry of the red wing (due to the brightening around $\Delta\lambda = \SI{0.05}{\nano\metre}$) starts to appear here in region $A$.
The negative $x$ region remains similar to $t=\SI{5}{\second}$ although the line core is less enhanced immediately adjacent to the flare.
Some time after the heating has ended ($t=\SI{15}{\second}$ and $t=\SI{25}{\second}$), the previous brightening (secondary peak) in the blue wing over $A$ is now a dimming, but there remains an enhancement in the red wing, which fades gradually.
In region $B$ the line appears shallower than for $t=\SI{10}{\second}$, but not as enhanced as for $t=\SI{5}{\second}$.
The negative $x$ region and $C$ remain similar to the $t=\SI{10}{\second}$ line profile, with the line core smoothly increasing in depth until reaching the quiet sun value as distance from the flare increases.

The \CaLine{} line profiles in the F9 simulation shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:CaFull2dPlot} tell a similar story, although the line width does not vary noticeably throughout the simulation.
The line is strongly enhanced in emission over $A$ for $t=\SI{5}{\second}$ and $t=\SI{10}{\second}$, with a slight red asymmetry.
At later times this line remains in emission with a more significant red asymmetry.
Region $B$ presents the start of a smooth transition back towards the quiet sun line profile, but retains asymmetry present in region $A$.
The negative $x$ region presents slight core enhancement over $a$, which is stronger during heating, before decaying slowly after heating.
Regions $b$, $c$, and $C$ do not change substantially over the course of the simulation.

The \Ha{} and \CaLine{} line profiles from the F10 simulation are shown in Figs.~\ref{Fig:HaFull2dPlotF10} and \ref{Fig:CaFull2dPlotF10} respectively.
The results are similar to those from the F9 simulations, but mostly exaggerated.
The line profiles over $A$ and $B$ are substantially broadened relative to those shown in the F9 simulation, which is not surprising, as much of this radiation comes from the flaring boundary condition, which is heated by a significantly more energetic beam.
During the cooling phase there is still a strong red asymmetry in this region; much stronger than that in the F9 model.
This is likely due to the higher velocities present in the flaring boundary.
This brightening encompasses the red wing, line core and enters the blue wing in region $A$.
Focussing on \Ha{} (Fig.~\ref{Fig:HaFull2dPlotF10}), the broadening in $B$, which is much more significant than that seen in the F9 case, is not constant in $x$.
For $t=5$ and $\SI{10}{\second}$ the line profile is enhanced over quiet values and substantially broadened, decaying slowly back to quiet values as the distance from the flare increases, whereas for $t=15$ and $\SI{25}{\second}$, this effect increases over the first half of $B$ before reducing over the second half.
This reduction continues into $C$ with the line appearing at its narrowest around $x=\SI{1.5}{\mega\metre}$, although this feature's distance from the flare decreases to $\sim\SI{1.2}{\mega\metre}$ at $t=\SI{25}{\second}$.

This broadening is somewhat mirrored in the negative $x$ region.
At early times the line appears significantly broadened over $a$, before decaying back towards the quiet sun profile over $b$ and $c$.
The variation over $b$ and $c$ is most significant for $t=10$ and $\SI{15}{\second}$ but remains important at $t=\SI{25}{\second}$.

Similarly to the F9 case, the \CaLine{} profile is most affected over $A$, presenting substantial broadening, initially symmetric but with a red brightening ($\Delta\lambda\approx\SI{0.03}{\nano\metre}$) appearing during the cooling phase.
During this phase the line remains broadened in the blue wing whilst the red wing half-width returns to a value similar to that found in quiet sun profile, despite the intensity enhancement.
These broadenings persist into $B$ and rapidly, but smoothly, decrease to the constant line width observed in the F9 case.
The variations in the intensity of the line continue into $C$ and decay smoothly back towards the quiet sun line profile.
The negative $x$ region is also similar to the F9 case, with the more significant effects appearing in region $a$.
The line core near the flare is shallower and narrower than in the F9 case, but this once again smoothly returns to values close to the quiet sun line profile over the course of $a$, with only a slight enhancement in the line core persisting into $b$.

We see that these optical line profiles can present significant core enhancements up to \SI{1}{\mega\metre} away from the flare boundary in these simulations when looking at a viewing angle that intersects this boundary (i.e. the positive $x$ region).
For viewing angles where this is not the case (the negative $x$ region), the effects on the line profile are much more modest, but measurable line core enhancements can still be detected over \SI{1}{\mega\metre} from the flare with wing effects up to \SI{0.4}{\mega\metre} from the flaring boundary.

\py[2DRT]|ch2DRT.get_figure('ZeroBcSpectro')|

As some of the rays emerging from positive $x$ region intersect the flaring boundary condition it is important to ascertain to what extent we are observing the ``conventional'' plane-parallel simulation, and what is due to two-dimensional effects.
To assess this we have synthesised the spectra of the \Ha{} and \CaLine{} lines using the populations computed for $t=\SI{10}{\second}$ in the F10 simulation, but setting the radiation from the boundary conditions to zero.
These spectra are shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:ZeroBcSpectro}.
For both lines, in region $A$, there is no emission in the far wings and continuum ($|\Delta\lambda|\ge\SI{0.07}{\nano\metre}$ for \Ha{} and $|\Delta\lambda|\ge\SI{0.02}{\nano\metre}$ for \CaLine{}) below \SI{0.25}{\mega\metre}.
For \Ha{}, the secondary peaks in the wings ($|\Delta\lambda|\approx\SI{0.06}{\nano\metre}$) protrude approximately \SI{100}{\kilo\metre} further toward the flaring boundary with the line core protruding approximately \SI{50}{\kilo\metre} less than these secondary peaks.
The situation is reversed for \CaLine{}: the line core protrudes similarly to the secondary \Ha{} peaks, and there is a slight recess of approximately \SI{50}{\kilo\metre} at wavelengths just beyond the secondary peaks ($|\Delta\lambda| > \SI{0.02}{\nano\metre}$) which returns smoothly and rapidly towards the continuum values.
There is no significant variation in extent in the negative $x$ region, with visible emission starting around $\SI{0.3}{\mega\metre}$ from the quiet boundary.

These distances are quite consistent with an approximate calculation using the ray direction.
The ray's projected inclination from the $z$ axis in the $x-z$ plane is \SI{2.24}{\degree} and the simulation has a vertical extent (from \Radyn{}) of approximately \SI{10}{\mega\metre}.
The transition region occurs at approximately $z=\SI{1.75}{\mega\metre}$.
So a ray entering the top boundary will have a horizontal displacement of approximately \SI{0.3}{\mega\metre} before entering the upper chromosphere, where the plasma starts to become optically thick at these wavelengths.

% Despite the lack of visible emission in these regions when the boundary conditions are set to zero, this does not mean that there are no effects due to the two dimensional nature of the simulation present.
% If the source function is low in these regions but there is still significant opacity then the observed radiation will be affected, but this cannot be seen without the incident radiation.
% Nevertheless,
There are clear effects due to the two-dimensional simulation beyond \SI{0.25}{\mega\metre} from the flaring boundary, and these lie well within the regions of important variation outlined in our imaging and spectroscopic analyses of the data.
To further investigate the flare's effect on the slab and why the continuum emission is not affected we will now see how the atomic populations within the slab vary.

To investigate how and where the flare's radiation field affects the plasma in our two-dimensional slab we can compare the atomic populations responsible for these spectral lines against their initial statistical equilibrium values.
For the F9 simulation Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dLevelsT10} shows the contribution function $\mathrm{C}_\mathrm{I}$ in the first column, the effect of local opacity on the outgoing radiation ($\chi_\nu/\tau_\nu$) in the second column, and the relative change of the upper and lower levels of the transitions considered from their initial statistical equilibrium values in the last two columns respectively.
The relative change of the population is computed as
\begin{equation}
    \frac{n_{i, t} - n_{i, 0}}{n_{i, t}},
\end{equation}
where $n_{i,t}$ is the number density of atomic level $i$ at time $t$.
The indexing of the levels shown in the plots is the indexing used by \Lw{}'s model atoms, which is zero indexed.
These properties are all shown at $t=\SI{10}{\second}$.
The contribution function and local opacity effect are computed by treating the atmosphere \added{close to the flaring boundary} at $x=\SI{50}{\kilo\metre}$ as plane-parallel and computing the contribution function in the traditional way.
This approach was taken due to the difficulty formulating the contribution function in the two-dimensional slab: the wavelength varying contributions of even a single output spectrum from a two-dimensional atmosphere cannot be represented directly on a two-dimensional plot, and this problem of dimensionality becomes greater still when investigating the contribution to each outgoing pixel.
We therefore use this simplified model as it should still inform us of the primary line forming and absorbing regions, especially as the thermodynamic structure of the two-dimensional slab is constant (other than the first column, copied from the flaring boundary).
The $\chi_\nu / \tau_\nu$ plot is computed equivalently to the contribution function\added{, and highlights where the local opacity is large but the optical depth is small.
In plane-parallel models with flows this can be used to highlight their effect on the line profile.}
The line profiles overplotted on the contribution function are the initial statistical equilibrium solution (dashed black), current emission from the flaring boundary (pink), and those observed from 200 (solid line) and \SI{400}{\kilo\metre} (dashed line) on either side of the flaring kernel (orange for the positive $x$ region and green for the negative $x$ region).
Whilst it is possible to compute the response function to perturbations in atmospheric parameters, this is not particularly insightful due to the assumption that the temperature and velocity fields remain fixed, and the coupling of the electron density through charge conservation again.

There is an enhancement in the upper and lower levels of the \Ha{} transition in the upper chromosphere appearing deeper in the atmosphere (down to an altitude of \SI{1}{\mega\metre}) closer to the flaring boundary condition.
The contribution function shows that the secondary peaks of the \Ha{} line profile form deeper in the atmosphere than the line core and approximately overlap the bottom of this enhanced region.
The depth of this enhancement decreases with distance from the flaring boundary, and corresponds well with the disappearance of the secondary peaks observed over region $B$.
Where the relative change is roughly similar in both the upper and lower levels of the \Ha{} line there will be both an increase in opacity, and an equivalent increase in emissivity.
This leads to no net change in the source function, thus this higher altitude region will proportionately contribute more significantly to the outgoing radiation as the increase in opacity blocks light from deeper in the ray's path.
This enhancement does not appear to be sufficient to directly create the secondary peaks in the \Ha{} profiles other than in the columns closest to the flaring boundary, as evidenced by the green line profiles, but the increased source function in the higher temperature region of the upper chromosphere is sufficient to significantly enhance the core of the line profile at large distances from the flare ($\sim\SI{1}{\mega\metre}$).

The \Caii{} populations, shown in the lower row of Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dLevelsT10}, are much more dramatically affected than the hydrogen populations previously discussed.
Both the upper and lower levels of the \CaLine{} spectral line are affected in the same $z=1.25-\SI{1.75}{\mega\metre}$ region at the $x=\SI{0}{\mega\metre}$ boundary, tapering off as $x$ increases.
The populations are substantially reduced from their initial statistical equilibrium values over this range, with a maximum relative change of approximately $-20$.
The lower level of this transition is significantly more reduced than the upper level, which will lead to a dramatic reduction in the local opacity whilst the emissivity remains less affected.
This will lead to an increase in the local source function as well as a reduction in the opacity affecting the line core radiation formed just below this level.
This reduction is likely due to photoionisation effects similar to those considered in Sec.~\ref{Sec:CaiiPhotoionisation}, and will be discussed more in the context of the F10 model.

An equivalent figure for the F10 simulation at $t=\SI{10}{\second}$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dLevelsF10T10}.
Due to the increased magnitude of the population changes in the transition region, it is harder to interpret the population change plots for the F10 model.
The upper and lower levels of the \Ha{} transition have been affected similarly to the F9 simulation, but the magnitude of the population increase is larger, however this does not significantly change the interpretation of the population effects on the line profile, which is corroborated by the line profiles shown in the left-most panel.
We also note, as evidenced by Fig.~\ref{Fig:ZeroBcSpectro}, that the enhancements in the \Ha{} populations are sufficient to produce small secondary peaks in the line profile, and the formation of these is clearer in the contribution function than it was in the F9 case.

Despite the upper level of the \CaLine{} line appearing darker than the lower level, given the differences in scaling, the lower level populations have again been reduced by a greater amount than the upper level.
Thus, the same interpretation as that given to the F9 simulation applies to the \CaLine{} line over the $z=1.25-\SI{1.75}{\mega\metre}$ region.
There is a secondary feature on these \Caii{} population relative change plots, an additional reduction in the $z=1-\SI{1.25}{\mega\metre}$ region.
This feature overlaps the core of the line contribution shown in the left-most panel, and appears to be a relatively similar reduction in both the upper and lower level populations (the reduction in the upper level population becomes larger than that of the lower level population approaching $x=\SI{1}{\mega\metre}$).

This will mostly lead to a reduction in local opacity, with a slight reduction in source function.
Thus the radiation from deeper in atmosphere, and that formed locally, is less attenuated in both the line-core forming region, and the optically-thick upper-chromospheric layers above the core forming region.
This reduction in local opacity appears to be well-validated by the extremely shallow core of the green line-profile in the first panel relative to the statistical equilibrium solution.

An interesting feature present in the \Caii{} plots is the angled white band starting from $z=\SI{1.2}{\mega\metre}$ at the flaring boundary and increasing in altitude with distance from the flare.
This indicates that there is little change in the calcium populations in this region, despite the much more monotonic variation in $x$ seen in the F9 case.
In Fig.~\ref{Fig:F10AnisotropyNe} the anisotropy of the radiation field leaving the flaring boundary and entering the slab over the range $z=0.9-\SI{1.7}{\mega\metre}$ for the timestep currently considered is shown, along with the electron density in this region of the slab.
The anisotropy is shown for the line cores of four different spectral lines (Ly$\alpha$, \Caii{} K, \Ha{}, \CaLine{}) along the vectors of angular quadrature used in the two-dimensional simulation.
These have been plotted so that their $x$ and $z$ components match the aspect ratio of the electron density plot in the right-hand panel.
Their sampling of the unit sphere is far more uniform than it appears here due to this significant stretching effect along $z$ and each vector's projection in the $x-z$ plane has been normalised.
This mapping allows their directions to be directly considered in terms of the adjacent panel.
The length and colour of each vector is then scaled by the associated intensity.
In the formation region of each line the line core radiation field is relatively isotropic, but the downgoing rays are greatly reduced above this region (as there is little emission or scattering).

In the right-hand panel there is an approximately triangular region of enhancement in the electron density (which is initially approximately uniform in $x$ taking the values at the $x=\SI{2}{\mega\metre}$ boundary), starting at the flaring boundary around $z=\SI{1.1}{\mega\metre}$, and increasing in distance from the flare with altitude up to $x=\SI{0.75}{\mega\metre}$ at $z=\SI{1.7}{\mega\metre}$.
The leading edge of this enhancement in electron density agrees well with the white band present in the \Caii{} population plots and the increase in electron density will locally increase the collisionality of the plasma.
This region also appears to overlap well with the incoming Ly$\alpha$ radiation, which will penetrate further at higher altitudes due to the higher temperature and the combination of radiation arriving close to horizontally and from below.
This, and other EUV radiation forming at similar temperatures, will likely be the cause of significant photoionisation.
The downward sloped population reduction seen in the \Caii{} population plots corresponds to the line core formation region ($\sim\SI{1.1}{\mega\metre}$) which also aligns with the highest altitude at which \CaLine{} radiation field is relatively isotropic.
Above this, the radiation field is primarily upgoing and injects energy into the slab in a non-uniform fashion.

\Ha{} appears relatively isotropic up to $z=\SI{1.45}{\mega\metre}$, with a slight upward anisotropy likely due to plasma motions of up to \SI{15}{\kilo\metre\per\second}, and becoming primarily upgoing above this.
From the contribution function in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dLevelsF10T10} the \Ha{} line core in the slab continues to form up to $z\approx\SI{1.75}{\mega\metre}$, and the anisotropic injection of energy is likely partially responsible for the diagonal structure seen in the population change plot of \Ha{}'s upper level.
\replaced{The \Caii{} K radiation field behaves similarly to \CaLine{}, but forms slightly higher, with a strong anisotropic component around $z=\SI{1.15}{\mega\metre}$, corresponding roughly with the bottom of the ionisation region depicted in the right-hand panel.
This line will be somewhat affected by the region of enhanced electron density, but less than either of the hydrogen lines presented.}
{ It is also interesting to note how significantly the strength of the \Caii{} K radiation drops above $z=\SI{1.15}{\mega\metre}$, which coincides approximately with the bottom of the ionisation region depicted in the right-hand panel.}

There is a significant enhancement of electron density within the triangular region shown in the right-hand panel of Fig.~\ref{Fig:F10AnisotropyNe}, which appears to be due primarily to photoionisation (as the temperature within the slab cannot change).
This increase in electron density affects line formation within the slab, both in terms of the line profiles, but also collisional rates and LTE populations.
It overlaps well with the more complex features shown in the population change plots for the F10 model and shows that the atomic populations responsible for these chromospheric lines can be significantly affected by the incoming radiation.

From the population change figures shown in this section it becomes clear that the far wings and continuum of both of these spectral lines are not affected by the incident radiation due to the lack of changes in the populations in the deep chromosphere and photosphere.
It is likely that the plasma here is both too optically thick, and collisionally coupled into LTE to be affected by the incoming radiation.
Thus, without a thermodynamic change deep in the slab it is not possible for the continuum levels to change.
\replaced{
It is not easy to disentangle how the atomic populations in flaring boundary and the slab both contribute to the outgoing radiation.
}{
It is not easy to disentangle the effects of the population changes in the flare from the effects on the outgoing radiation.}
Nevertheless, it is clear that the flare's effects penetrate far into the slab and have a lasting impact on the populations, on both spatial and temporal scales that should be easily resolvable with upcoming optical instruments.

\subsection{Importance of Time-Dependence}\label{Sec:2dTimeDepSE}

Due to the need to solve the radiative transfer problem at every timestep in the \Radyn{} simulation, the full time-dependent treatment is extremely computationally demanding.
If these effects are not important then the style of simulation presented here can likely be accelerated dramatically by performing a statistical equilibrium solution for the slab illuminated by the flaring boundary at each timestep of interest (which is likely to be many fewer than the total number of timesteps needed for the time-dependent solution).

Statistical equilibrium and time-dependent solutions for the \Ha{} line at $t=\SI{10}{\second}$ in the F9 simulation are shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dCompareStatEqTimeDep}.
Region $A$ appears similar in both cases, but there are significant differences in the line width and core depth outside of this region.
It is difficult to directly compare these plots, however the effect is clear when the intensity in this line is integrated and plotted as a function of $x$ position.
This is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dCompareIntegratedHa} for both $t=\SI{10}{\second}$ (solid) and $t=\SI{15}{\second}$ (dashed) with the statistical equilibrium treatments shown in blue and the time-dependent treatments shown in orange.
The enhancement of \Ha{} and the region over which it is enhanced varies substantially between the two treatments, showing that for this line there is a clear need to perform this time-dependent treatment.
There is significantly more intensity present in the line in regions $B$ and $C$, as well as in all of the negative $x$ region when using the time-dependent treatment.
An equivalent comparison is shown for the \CaLine{} line in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dCompareIntegratedCa}.
The effect is less significant here, but nevertheless easily visually resolvable, and interestingly is the inverse of what is seen for the \Ha{} line, as there is less intensity in the time-dependent case than in statistical equilibrium.

The maximum difference between the treatments appears where the primary contribution to the rays is from the two-dimensional slab between a few hundred \si{\kilo\metre} and \SI{1}{\mega\metre} from the flaring boundary.
For the positive $x$ region, the radiation from the boundary mostly dominates region $A$, but the local conditions within the slab, in particular the electron density, are critical for the line formation along the rays observed from region $B$.
As the flaring boundary is not dominating the outgoing rays from region $a$, and these rays look deeper into the slab rather than towards the flaring boundary we immediately see the differences between the treatments close to $x=\SI{0}{\mega\metre}$ in the negative $x$ region.

In the wave-heated \Radyn{} simulation of \citet{Carlsson2002} the settling time for hydrogen to return to equilibrium populations was found to be on the order of $10^3-10^5\,\si{\second}$, much longer than the entire \SI{50}{\second} simulation duration shown here.
The effect is likely to be less pronounced here with no thermodynamic variation possible in the slab, and only excitation by incident radiation from the flaring boundary condition, but given the large difference between these treatments at both $t=\SI{10}{\second}$ and $t=\SI{15}{\second}$ it seems prudent to adopt the time-dependent treatment by default when exploring the present phenomenon in flares.

From the discussions in Sec.~\ref{Sec:TimeDepSE} it is reasonable to investigate whether these discrepancies between the time-dependent and statistical equilibrium treatments can be overcome by applying statistical equilibrium with the electron density fixed to the value computed from the time-dependent situation (under the effects of charge conservation).

Figs.~\ref{Fig:2dCompareStatEqTimeDepLoadNe} and \ref{Fig:2dCompareStatEqTimeDepLoadNeCa} show the \Ha{} and \CaLine{} line profiles respectively at $t=\SI{15}{\second}$ using the electron density loaded from the time-dependent model.
There remains a significant difference in the \Ha{} line profiles between the two treatments; this is particularly visible in the gradual widening of the line core over regions $B$ and $C$ present in the time-dependent treatment that is barely visible in the statistical equilibrium treatment.
We note that the line-core narrowing around $x=\SI{0.5}{\mega\metre}$ in this statistical equilibrium case is not present in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dCompareStatEqTimeDep} and must be due to the use of the electron density from the time-dependent model.
The \Ha{} line profile is therefore closer to that expected from the time-dependent case, but significant differences remain, and it appears that a full time-dependent treatment is necessary to capture the evolution of the hydrogen populations.

\CaLine{}, on the other hand, agrees well with the expected solution when computed in statistical equilibrium with the provided electron density.
This is not surprising following the analysis undertaken in Sec.~\ref{Sec:TimeDepSE}, but we note that this is only one timestep of the model.

Attempts were made to compare these treatments at other timesteps but the process of converging a statistical equilibrium solution with the fixed electron density provided from the time-dependent model proved to be unreliable, and the models at $t=5,\,10,$ and \SI{11}{\second} failed to converge.
This approach therefore appears unsuited to the models presented here, but from the comparison of the \CaLine{} line profiles and the analysis undertaken in the previous chapter it is plausible that a situation with a detailed static treatment of hydrogen, where the populations and electron density can be known approximately, could produce relatively accurate \CaLine{} line profiles, at lower computational cost than the full time-dependent method employed in this chapter.

Whilst it would be nice to evaluate the radiation with arbitrary horizontal precision, the limitations of computer performance do not allow this.
Clearly, we want to investigate the problem at a resolution similar or better than that provided by our observations.
If the problem produces smoothly varying solutions then it is not necessarily required to run the simulation at the same resolution as the observations; however we anticipate fine features that only span one or two pixels, and thus use a \SI{50}{\kilo\metre} element spacing as our baseline.
This is similar to the \SI{42}{\kilo\metre} resolution provided by CRISP observation against which our results will be compared.

\py[2DRT]|ch2DRT.get_figure('HorizontalResolutionComparison05s')|

To analyse whether this resolution appears sufficient we shall compare the statistical equilibrium solution to our problem (as this only requires the calculation of a single timestep, rather than the entire model) at a horizontal grid spacing of both \SI{50}{\kilo\metre} and \SI{25}{\kilo\metre} at several timesteps in the F9 simulation and compare the outgoing radiation.
It is reasonable to use a statistical equilibrium treatment for this as we are primarily testing the performance of the formal solver on this atmospheric configuration, and it should converge to similar solutions in both cases if sufficient resolution is used.
The incident radiation at the $x=\SI{0}{\mega\metre}$ boundary is the same in both instances and the atmospheric parameters are horizontally uniform, although the electron density in the slab is allowed to vary through charge conservation.
In Figs.~\ref{Fig:HorizontalResolutionComparison05s}--\ref{Fig:HorizontalResolutionComparison15s} we show the ratio of the outgoing radiation from the 41 point (\SI{50}{\kilo\metre}) and 81 point (\SI{25}{\kilo\metre}) models at $t=\{5, 10, \SI{15}{\second}\}$ respectively.
The maximum fractional error is shown in the upper-left corner of each panel.

\py[2DRT]|ch2DRT.get_figure('HorizontalResolutionComparison10s')|
\py[2DRT]|ch2DRT.get_figure('HorizontalResolutionComparison15s')|

The location of the peak differences between the treatments in the positive and negative $x$ regions appear to follow a pattern similar to those considered in Sec.~\ref{Sec:2dTimeDepSE}, with the largest differences in positive $x$ appearing in region $B$ while those in negative $x$ appear in $a$.
The maximum difference is found to be an enhancement of around 14\% in both line cores at $x\approx\SI{0.6}{\mega\metre}$ for the ratio of lower resolution simulation to the higher resolution.
This is not an insignificant variation, but it does not appear to vary dramatically during the simulation, and the variation is smooth, with no significant effects on the line shape.

The computational cost of using the higher resolution model is unfortunately not a simple linear ratio of the number of points (i.e. the 81 point simulation does not take simply $\sim 2\times$ longer than the 41 point simulation).
Indeed, the cost of each iteration scales close to linearly with the number of points in the atmosphere (for a given angular and wavelength quadrature), but the number of iterations needed also increases with finer grid sizes, as the information carried by the approximate $\Lambda$ operator takes longer to cross the grid.
For this reason the 81 point simulation takes $\sim 2.4\times$ longer than the 41 point simulation.
We therefore opted to use the 41 point spatial grid in all models presented in this chapter, primarily for computational reasons, but are confident that the solution obtained is reasonable.
% This computational scaling is more significant with the addition of points in $z$, which are already very dense in some regions.

Whilst any real world flare situation is far more complex than the simplified two-dimensional model presented in the previous section, we will compare these results against observations of the two-ribbon M1.1 flare SOL 20140906T17:09 from the CRISP instrument, observed in \Ha{} and \CaLine{}.
This data was prepared following the standard procedure described in Sec.~\ref{Sec:CRISP}.
A context image of the region in the core of the \CaLine{} line at the flare peak is shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dCaContext}.
We have selected a region on edge of the western ribbon for this comparison, which is highlighted in blue in both the left- and right-hand panels of this figure.
The chosen region is 100 x 10\,{}px, with each pixel of the CRISP instrument being $0.057^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim\SI{42}{\kilo\metre}$).
This region was chosen as it represents the intersection between the flare ribbon and some of the quieter material present in the data (the east ribbon overlaps a sunspot), lies approximately perpendicular to the structure visible here, and is close to the region analysed by \citet{Kuridze2015}.
We note that for both spectral lines, the angular size of 2\,px is less than the diffraction limit of the SST at these wavelengths (Sec.~\ref{Sec:CRISP}), and this may slightly affect the extents of the enhancements measured in this data.

To investigate the effects presented in the simulation we shall analyse the variation of the radiation in the selected region as a function of $x$ location and time.
The 10\,{}px in $y$ are averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
These timeslices are then plotted for three different wavelengths, corresponding to the two wings and the line core, and shown in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dCrispCaSliceEnhance}.
We take the right-hand edge of this region as representing an approximation of the background intensity and compute the distance from the left-hand boundary at which a 40\% enhancement over this background level is seen.
This extent is shown as the blue lines in Fig.~\ref{Fig:2dCrispCaSliceEnhance}.
The bright expansion of the flare ribbon can be seen on these plots as the triangular region that collapses rapidly around 17:11.
This figure is similar in concept to the imaging plots (Figs.~\ref{Fig:2DHaF9}--\ref{Fig:2DCaF10}) produced from our models, where the ``ribbon'' was held at the $x=0$ boundary.

We can compare the differences between the extents for these different spectral positions on both lines to investigate the differences in emission throughout the slab.
This is shown for \CaLine{} and \Ha{} in Figs.~\ref{Fig:2dCrispCaEnhanceDists} and \ref{Fig:2dCrispHaEnhanceDists} respectively.
The comparison here is against the line core, so an offset of $0$\,{}px implies that the enhancement is co-spatial in the line core and at this wavelength.
For \CaLine{}, prior to 17:05, there is little difference between both line wings and the line core, although the blue wing enhancement on average extends slightly further than the red wing, and just prior to the flare peak, up to $5$\,{}px further than the line core.
As the flare peaks, the enhancement of the line core extends consistently $5-10$\,{}px further from the ribbon than either of the wings, and this trend continues for the remainder of the dataset.
For \Ha{}, before $\sim$17:07, the red wing enhancement remains $\sim$15\,{}px behind the line core, whilst the blue wing starts in this region, then extends past the line core at $\sim$17:00 before falling back to a similar offset to the red wing at $\sim$17:07.
From this point onwards, both wings remain at a similar offset, typically remaining $10-30$\,{}px less extended than the line core.

We can compute this same metric for the \replaced{simulations of slabs adjacent to F9 and F10 flares}{ two simulations} presented in this chapter, and these are shown in Figs.~\ref{Fig:2dSimCaEnhanceDists} and \ref{Fig:2dSimHaEnhanceDists} respectively for the \CaLine{} and \Ha{} results.
The red and blue wings are again shown with the same colours, the solid lines refer to the F9 simulation and the dashed lines the F10 simulation.
We note that there is a substantial variation in viewing angle between these simulations and the set of observations investigated here.
The simulations use a viewing angle $\mu_z\approx0.951$ (an inclination of \SI{2.24}{\degree} when projected into the $x-z$ plane), whilst this observation was taken at $\mu\approx0.565$.
If the same viewing angle is used with the simulation then all of the ``pixels'' at the top of the atmosphere ``look'' directly into the flaring boundary condition, and the effect we wish to investigate cannot be resolved without performing simulations with substantially larger extents in $x$.
Due to the prohibitive computational cost of this (a similar horizontal spatial resolution would still be required), we instead choose to compare the simulations using this smaller viewing angle as a ``first-order approximation'' of the problem.
In both cases, the size of a pixel is similar (\SI{42}{\kilo\metre} for CRISP and \SI{50}{\kilo\metre} in the simulation); whilst the pixels in the data are nominally smaller this does not include the effects of viewing the inclined solar surface so we compare these extents in pixels directly.

The \CaLine{} line behaves similarly in both the F9 and F10 simulations, with the line core immediately extending significantly further than the wings (by $9-13$\,{}px) as the heating begins.
Around $t=\SI{30}{\second}$ the extent of the blue wing enhancement decreases significantly, whilst the red wing enhancement remains approximately constant, slightly approaching the line core.
This is not in agreement with the observations where the red wing offset decreases relative to the blue wing offset later in the cooling phase.
The consistency of the red enhancement is likely due to the strong red asymmetry present in region $A$ of the simulation at later times, whilst the core remains notably enhanced further into the slab.
Nevertheless, the extent of the line core enhancement relative to the wings remains comparable to the observation, in the $5-20$\,{}px range.

There are significant differences between the F9 and F10 simulations for the \Ha{} line.
In the less energetic simulation, the line core offset rapidly jumps to $\sim22$\,{}px further than both the red and the blue wings.
As the heating ends there is a short-term variation (lasting $\sim\SI{1}{\second}$) in the red and blue wing extents, as both approach the line core extent.
For the remainder of the cooling period, the line core remains $15-20$\,{}px more extended than both of the line wings.
This is approximately comparable to the observed offset from 17:10 onwards ($10-30$\,{}px), and the short-term spike after the heating ends could be compared to the spike in the observation just prior to 17:10, although the timescales are very different.
For the F10 simulation, the difference in extent between the line core and the wings remains small during heating, but after the heating ends increases relatively rapidly to $\sim13$\,{}px.
The red wing takes approximately $\SI{8}{\second}$ longer to drop back to this level.

Qualitatively, there are a number of features that agree between the simulations and this observation: from the flare peak onwards both line cores remain significantly more extended than their respective wings, and both simulations support this, with comparable changes in enhancement offset.
After the flare peak, the line-core remains visibly extended into the quieter region adjacent to the western ribbon, up to 20\,{}px further than an equivalent enhancement in the wings.
In both the simulation and the observation this is in part due to the variation of the line profile shape, changing from either a strong emission or centrally reversed enhanced line on the ribbon to a much deeper absorption line off-ribbon.
Given the additional complexity of the observed configuration, the difference in viewing angle, timescale, and the likelihood of thermodynamic changes occurring in proximity to the flare (including Doppler shifts from plasma flows), it is unwise to attempt to interpret the comparison of these offsets in much greater depth than this qualitative agreement.
The basic agreement between the simulation and observation suggests that this simulation is an accurate ``first-order'' approximation of this problem, and is capturing some of the observed effects through the treatment of radiation alone, although further simulation of more complex configurations and in-depth comparisons are needed.

\added{
Future comparisons between this style of modelling and observations can follow the methodology presented here, although it would be advantageous to more closely match the viewing angle of the observation and simulation.
Whilst it is important to consider inclined observations, when using the approach presented here, slightly inclined simulations are significantly less computationally intensive than ones with extreme inlcination, due to the need for the rays exiting the top of the atmosphere to not simply sample the flaring boundary.
This can likely be addressed by modifying the functionality of the formal solver for the final synthesis, so as to pick rays that will intersect with the chromospheric regions of interest.

\section{Discussions}

The basic two-dimensional simulations shown in Sec.~\ref{Sec:2dSimResults} demonstrate that even for a two-dimensional slab of plasma with a fixed quiet Sun temperature structure, the time-dependent illumination by an adjacent flare will create significant variations in the level populations deep in the slab, causing notable enhancements in the observed \Ha{} and \CaLine{} optical spectral lines \SI{1}{\mega\metre} and further from the flaring boundary.
Traditional inversion techniques performed on this region are likely to lead to incorrect conclusions as to the thermodynamic structure of the slab, as the outgoing radiation is not necessarily directly linked to the slab's local thermodynamic properties, but is instead significantly influenced by the incident radiation.
\added{If the thermodynamic properties were allowed to vary through absorption of radiation and cross-field heat conduction (it is difficult to foresee other terms being possible without resorting to 2D RMHD simulation), then the local thermodynamic properties would be more closely linked to the observed radiation and changes in continuum flux would become possible.
We have shown that the effects of radiation alone in the chromosphere are sufficient to produce significant changes in the observed line profiles and it does not seem likely that thermodynamic effects would dominate given the magnitude of the radiative effects, so care should still be taken when applying traditional inversion techniques.}

It is necessary to perform a time-dependent treatment of the hydrogen populations in this problem, taking into account the effects of non-equilibrium ionisation, and this species' slow return to statistical equilibrium, despite the lack of time-varying thermodynamic modifications of the quiet Sun slab.
With the electron density provided by non-equilibrium hydrogen ionisation\replaced{, a statistical equilibrium treatment of calcium}{ calcium treated in statistical equilibrium} was able to accurately reproduce the time-dependent \CaLine{} line profile (similarly to our results from Chap.~\ref{Chap:TimeDepRt}).
We note that this result is valid only for one timestep of this model, as it was the only one that converged, suggesting the importance of the full time-dependent treatment.

The enhancement effects are not uniform as a function of wavelength, with the line core enhancement typically extending up to several hundred \si{\kilo\metre} further than the enhancements in the line wings.
This may have implications for the calculation of filling factors, due to the wavelength dependence of this ``smearing'', but more detailed simulation and analysis are needed to attempt to prescribe any functional form for this.

Nevertheless, these enhancements are on scales that are observable with current generation instruments such as SST/CRISP, and are likely to become more important with the improved resolution of upcoming telescopes such as DKIST.
We have presented an initial analysis of these effects in SST/CRISP data and found enhancements of a similar order of magnitude sharing a number of observational characteristics, but significant differences remain, likely due to the limitations of our simple model.
It is likely that the temperatures in such a slab will vary due to the absorption of radiation, thermal conduction and other modes of heating occurring adjacent to the flare.
Thus, the results presented here likely underestimate the magnitude of these line enhancement effects \added{which could be more accurately captured by using the detailed two-dimensional radiative transfer available in \Lw{} in conjunction with an RMHD model responding to the incoming energy.}
